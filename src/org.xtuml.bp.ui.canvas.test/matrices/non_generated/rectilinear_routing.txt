Results:
1.  lineOrthogonal      "The line was not routed such that all segments are orthogonal."
2.  segmentSameSide     "The segment did not remain attached on the original side."
3.  segmentNewSideEast  "The segment did not move to the east side of attached element."
4.  segmentNewSideWest  "The segment did not move to the west side of attached element."
5.  segmentNewSideNorth "The segment did not move to the north side of attached element."
6.  segmentNewSideSouth "The segment did not move to the south side of attached element."
