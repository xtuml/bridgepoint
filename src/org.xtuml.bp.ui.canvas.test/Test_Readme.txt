To build the test plugin
------------------------

- Rebuild the project  (PT_HOME and PT_HOME_DRIVE environment
    variables must be defined in order to find bak2sql, which
    must be installed)
- To create build.xml, select plugin.xml, and invoke context
    menu 'Create Ant Build File'
- Select build.xml, invoke context menu 'Run Ant...'
- Select the targets in this order:  clean, build.jars, zip.plugin
- Run Ant

To setup the test environment
-----------------------------

- Create a directory named 'eclipse-test' as a sibling to your main eclipse directory
- Unzip the eclipse SDK into eclipse-test
- Unzip org.eclipse.test, and org.eclipse.ant.optional.junit plugins
   into the eclipse-test/eclipse/plugins directory.  These plugins are
   found in the phoenix:/software/software_archive/Eclipse/plug-ins/org.eclipse.test
- Copy the org.antlr_2.7.2 plugin into eclipse-test/eclipse/plugins

- Either get the Tiger plugin distribution from http://phoenix.projtech.com/tiger_releases
   or build it using feature-pkg/build.xml
- Unzip the BridgePoint distribution into the eclipse-test/eclipse directory
- Place the file canvas.bat (content should be pasted from below) in the eclipse-test
- Install unzip (www.info-zip.org) and put it in the path

To execute the test
-------------------

- cd eclipse-test
- canvas.bat
- Results are in eclipse-test\CanvasTestSuite.xml


canvas.bat contents
-------------------

rmdir /S /Q eclipse\canvas_folder

cd  eclipse\plugins

rem this is the project where the test plugin was built
set WORKSPACE_PATH=C:\eclipse\workspace\org.xtuml.bp.ui.canvas.test\

unzip -qq -o %WORKSPACE_PATH%org.xtuml.bp.ui.canvas.test_*.zip 

cd ..\..
java -DWORKSPACE_PATH=%WORKSPACE_PATH% -DLOGFILE_PATH=canvas_folder/.metadata/.log -cp eclipse\startup.jar org.eclipse.core.launcher.Main -noupdate -application org.eclipse.test.uitestapplication -dev bin -data eclipse\canvas_folder formatter=org.apache.tools.ant.taskdefs.optional.junit.XMLJUnitResultFormatter,CanvasTestSuite.xml -testPluginName org.xtuml.bp.ui.canvas.test -className CanvasTestSuite -dev bin -os win32 -ws win32 -arch x86 -nl en_US

rem end of file

To execute the test in your workspace
-------------------------------------

- In the Java perspective, select Run/Run...
- Select JUnit Plug-in Test, context menu New
- Rename the new configuration to 'Canvas Test'
- On the Test tab, under 'Run a single test', specify 
  project 'org.xtuml.bp.ui.canvas.test' and test class 'CanvasTestSuite'
- Change workspace data to '${eclipse_home}/bp_tests/canvas'
- Change VM Arguments to 
  '-Xmx512m -XX:MaxPermSize=80m -DWORKSPACE_PATH=${workspace_loc}/org.xtuml.bp.ui.canvas.test/ -DLOGFILE_PATH=${eclipse_home}/bp_tests/canvas/.metadata/.log'
- Add '-noupdate ' to the front of the Program Arguments  
- Check 'Clear workspace data before launching'
- On the Plug-ins and Fragments page, check the top radio button.
   (Launch with all workspace and enabled external plug-ins)
- Select the 'Tracing' tab:
  On the checkbox on the left, select bp.core and ui.canvas as plugins that
  support tracing.
  For each plugin, on the checkbox on the right, select the 'debug' and
  'debug/consistency' checkboxes.
The test results will be written to a file in the Eclipse top-level folder.

Perform the same steps above, replacing the test suite for
CanvasCCPTestSuite.

Creation of Expected Results
----------------------------

This should only be done when the plugin behavior has been altered such that
the expected results change.

To do this, perform the steps in the previous section if you have not 
already done so.  However, specify 'CanvasTestResultSuite' as the test class.

When run, this overwrites the files in the subdirectories of expected_results.
If necessary, the files that you wish to be updated should be made read write 
with Team | Edit before recreation. Finally, check these files into CVS, 
providing a comment explaining what changed.
