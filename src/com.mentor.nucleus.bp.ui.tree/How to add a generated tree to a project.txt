How to add a generated tree to a project in 10 minutes or less
----------------------------------------

1) If you do not already have a working project,
   Use the Eclipse new plug-in project wizard to create a new project

2) Add an ANT builder to your project
  a) Right-click on your project and choose properties
  b) Click "Builders"
  c) Click "New" on the right hand side to create a new builder
  d) Select Ant Build and click OK

3) Configure the Main tab
   a) Name your builder anything, such as "Generate Skeleton tree files"
   b) For the BuildFile, paste the following:  
     ${workspace_loc:/com.mentor.nucleus.bp.ui.tree/generate_skeleton_files.xml}
   c) For the Base Directory, click the Browse Workspace button and select your
      project
   d) For Arguments (Note, you may need to resize your window to see the 
      arguments pane), customize the following and paste them into the pane:

      Required arguments:
      project             - The package name of your project
      project_with_slash  - The path underneath the src directory where the 
                            generated files should be placed.  Typically, this
                            is identical to the project argument, but with / 
                            instead of .
      prefix              - The project specific prefix that should be placed in
                            front of the filenames of many generated files.
                            For example, a prefix of InstanceExplorer will 
                            generate InstanceExplorerContentProvider.java

      The following lines can be copied and pasted into your arguments textbox
      and must be modified to match your project:
-Dproject=com.mentor.nucleus.bp.ui.tree.test
-Dproject_with_slash=com/mentor/nucleus/bp/ui/tree/test
-Dprefix=TreeTest


      Optional arguments:
      Many properties are set in 
      com.mentor.nucleus.bp.ui.tree/generate_skeleton_files.xml in order to make
      the generation more flexible.  For a comprehensive list of available 
      properties to set, please open that file and examine the properties at the
      top of the file.  Any property defined in that file can be overridden by
      passing a new value as an argument.
      The following properties while not required are also commonly used:
      plugin_package      - The package name where the plugin is located
      plugin_name         - The name of the plugin's java file
      dot_views           - If this project places view files into a separate
                            views folder and package, then set this define to 
                            that folder's name with a . in front of it.
      slash_views         - If this project places view files into a separate 
                            views folder and package, then set this define to 
                            that folder's name with a / in front of it.
      dot_actions         - If this project places action files into a separate
                            actions folder and package, then set this define to
                            that folder's name with a . in front of it.
      slash_actions       - If this project places action files into a separate
                            actions folder and package, then set this define to
                            that folder's name with a / in front of it.
      dot_adapters        - If this project places adapter files into a separate
                            adapters folder and package, then set this define to
                            that folder's name with a . in front of it.
      slash_adapters      - If this project places adapter files into a separate
                            adapters folder and package, then set this define to
                            that folder's name with a / in front of it.

-Dplugin_package=com.mentor.nucleus.bp.ui.tree.test
-Dplugin_name=TreeTestPlugin
-Ddot_views=.views
-Dslash_views=/views
-Ddot_actions=
-Dslash_actions=
-Ddot_adapters=.adapters
-Dslash_adapters=/adapters


4) Configure the Refresh tab
  a) Click the Refresh tab
  b) Place a check in the "Refresh resources upon completion" box.
     "The entire workspace" should already be selected

5) Configure the Targets tab
  a) Click the Targets tab
  -) Both After a clean and Manual Build should already have the default target
     selected.
  -) Since generating these skeleton files is rare, you can also leave no target
     selected in the Auto Build.
  b) Click the Set Targets... button to the right of During a Clean.
  c) Uncheck the "all" target
  d) Check the clean_all target, and click OK

6) Click OK to finish configuring your builder

7) Make your new builder execute before any other builders for your project
  a) Click the name of your new Ant builder once to select it
  b) Click the "Up" button until your new Ant builder is at the top of the list

8) Click OK to exit the properties window

9) Build your project to generate the customizable files
  a) Right-click on your project, and choose "Build Project"


10) Follow the directions that appear in the console window
At the time of this writing, the following message will be displayed, but
the console message takes priority over the following text:

Skeleton files for <Your View Name> have been generated.
The files that have been generated should be added to a version control system
like CVS.  These files will not be regenerated.  You will see some compiler
errors because some of these files depend on files that will be generated later.
Along with the generated files, a new builder has been added to your project
that will run a generate.xml script. Additional Plug-in dependencies may have
also been added to your project.

** Important**
If you have any hand-written files in your project, you should also update the
cvs_java_files property in com.mentor.nucleus.bp.ui.session/generate.xml file.
Otherwise, when you next clean this project, your files will be deleted.

Once you have added these files to version control, simply build the project
again, without a clean, to run the new builder and generate the remaining files.

After that, you can run verifier and open your new view to see an instance
explorer.  Use this view as a starting point to build whatever tree view you
require.
