How to add a node to a generated tree
----------------------------------------

Quickstart
------------

  Just skip to the "Instructions" section at the end of this document.

Background
------------
It may be useful to understand some basics about how generator is used before
modifying a generated tree.  Feel free to skip to the "Instructions" section if
you like though.  When you build a project like bp.ui.explorer that contains a
generated tree, many things happen under the hood:

* Building the project launches each builder associated with that project in
  sequence.  You can see all the builders by right clicking on the project
  and choosing Properties.  Then select Builders.

* The first builder in the list will most likely execute an ANT script called
  generate.xml in the root folder of the project.

* Previous incarnations of the generator required that all models be input as
  a .sql file.  Today, generator works perfectly well with the .xtuml model
  format, but most of our build scripts still expect a .sql file in a sql/
  folder.  For that reason alone, most of our build scripts make a copy of the
  xtuml file and place it in the sql folder with a .sql extension.

* If you open a .xtuml model file in a text editor, you will find a series of
  INSERT commands like you would expect in a database.  However, the tables
  must exist somewhere right?  The MC-Java\Schemagen.arc file is a tool that
  will take any model use it to create another sql file containing all the
  CREATE TABLE commands.  Generator then will read both files to create the
  database tables and then populate it with all the data from the model.

* If you look inside com.mentor.nucleus.bp.ui.tree/sql/UITree_schema.sql with a
  text editor, you will find tables that match the classes in the UITree.xtuml
  file.  The ROP statements define the relationships between the classes, and
  the MC means "many conditional".

* generate.xml is an ANT script that will in turn call other ANT scripts, but it
  also will execute xtumlmc_gen_erate.exe as a java command in order to process
  archetypes such as BuildTree.arc.  Here is an example from ...bp.ui.explorer:
  
    <exec vmlauncher="false" failonerror="true" 
                             executable="${bp_bin_dir}\xtumlmc_gen_erate" >
        <env key="PTC_MC_ARC_DIR" value="${mcj_path}"/>
        <env key="CHAIN_UTIL_DIR" value="${chain_util_path}"/>          
        <arg line="-nopersist 
            -import ${mcj_path}/ooa_schema.sql 
            -import ${schema.output_path}/UITree_schema.sql 
            -import ../com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core/sql/ooaofooa.sql 
            -import sql/UITree.pei.sql 
            -arch arc/BuildTree.arc" />
    </exec>

  In the above sample, the generator is called.  The ooa_schema is used to
  create database tables for the core model.  Those tables are then populated
  with insert statements found in the ooaofooa.sql file.  However, this project
  includes the Model Explorer view, which includes a generated tree.  So in
  addition to creating a database containing the core model, the above sample
  will also create tables in the database for a tree and populate those tables
  with the data stored in com.mentor.nucleus.bp.ui.explorer/sql/UITree.pei.sql.
  Once the database is complete, the BuildTree.arc archetype file is executed,
  and it can make queries into that database in order to create customized java
  code.  

* Therefore, the most important file in modifying a generated tree is the
  sql/UITree.pei.sql file in your project because that file contains all the
  tree data that is used to populate the database tables for the UITree model.


Introduction
------------
In the sql/UITree.pei.sql file in your project you will find INSERT statements
for 2 tables: 
    TNS � Tree node specification
    TPS � Tree Parenthood specification

Each parameter for these statements matches the attributes for the class in the
UITree.xtuml model.

    INSERT INTO T_TNS VALUES (
        Tree_Node_Spec_ID       A unique identifier for the tree entry.

        Icon   (DEPRICATED)     (This field is currently ignored and serves no
                                purpose.  The icon is specified in the bp.core
                                project under sql.ooaofooa_hierarchy.pei.sql for
                                the matching class keyletters.  If you cannot
                                find a TNS entry in that file for the class
                                keyletters you intend to use in your tree, just
                                add a TNS statement to that file too in order
                                to specify the icon to use.  The icon file
                                should then be stored in the 
                                ....nucleus.bp.core/icons/metadata folder)
                                A string identifying the icon to be shown in the
                                tree next to the entry.

        Key_Lett                The class key letters for the object represented
                                by this tree entry.
                                Examples: O_OBJ, SM_ISM, S_DOM

        Label                   If present, specifies a constant string to be
                                displayed for the text part of the tree entry.
                                Used for entries which have no name of their own
                                but which represent a named part of something
                                else.
                                Examples: Instance State Model,Class State Model

        NamingAttribute         If present, specifies an attribute of the client
                                model that should be read to provide the text
                                part of the tree entry.

        NamingAttributeRelChain If present, specifies how to navigate from the
                                represented entity to the entity owning the
                                attribute specified in 'NamingAttribute'. If
                                empty, 'NamingAttribute' is assumed to specify
                                an attribute in the represented entity itself.
                                This is used in cases where the name of
                                something is held elsewhere than the current
                                entity (often in a supertype).
                                Examples: ->SM_SEVT[R526]->SM_EVT[R525] 
                                (specifies the location of the name of a local
                                event), ->S_DT[R17] (specifies the location of
                                the name of a user defined data type)

        CategoryName            A unique string that identifies this tree entry
                                type. Used to ensure that entries of the same
                                type are sorted together and to allow entries of
                                the same type to be hidden together.  This name
                                will match the filters list.
                                Examples: Domains, Classes, Attributes, States

        Sorted                  This attribute is true if there exists a
                                relationship that sorts the order of the nodes.
                                The sorting algorithm is defined elsewhere
                                (core/mdl/ooa_hierarchy).


    INSERT INTO T_TPS VALUES (
        Parent_Tree_Node_Spec_ID The Tree_Node_Spec_ID of the parent element

        Child_Tree_Node_Spec_ID  The Tree_Node_Spec_ID of the child element that
                                 will be shown underneath the parent element in
                                 the tree.

        ParentChildRelChain      Specifies how to find children given a parent
                                 and a parent given any child.  The traversal is
                                 specified in the sense parent -> child, but
                                 note that the relationship chain is traversed
                                 in both directions.

                                 A valid traversal may yield an instance or set
                                 in the parent -> child direction but must
                                 always yield an instance when traversed in the
                                 opposite (child -> parent) direction.

                                 Examples: ->SM_SM[R517]->SM_STATE[R501]
                                 (specifies the states of an instance or class
                                 based state chart), ->S_DT[R14]->S_UDT[R17]
                                 (specifies the user defined datatypes of a
                                 domain)

Let's look at just a few statements and explain what they mean:
    INSERT INTO T_TNS VALUES (
        Tree_Node_Spec_ID        12,
        Icon                     'event.gif',
        Key_Lett                 'SM_EVT',
        Label                    '',
        NamingAttribute          'Mning',
        NamingAttributeRelChain  '',
        CategoryName             'Events',
        Sorted                   false);

    INSERT INTO T_TNS VALUES (
        Tree_Node_Spec_ID        25,
        Icon                     'statechart.gif',
        Key_Lett                 'SM_ISM',
        Label                    'Instance State Machine',
        NamingAttribute          '',
        NamingAttributeRelChain  '',
        CategoryName             'Instance State Machines',
        Sorted                   false);

    INSERT INTO T_TPS VALUES (
        Parent_Tree_Node_Spec_ID 25,
        Child_Tree_Node_Spec_ID  12,
        ParentChildRelChain      '->SM_SM[R517]->SM_EVT[R502]');

These three statements create two nodes that represent two classes: 
State Machine Event and Instance State Machine.  In the tree, the Instance
State Machine will be shown first, with all the events for that state machine
shown as children under that node.  In order to find all the events for a
given state machine, a database query will traverse from SM_ISM to SM_SM
across R517 to SM_EVT across R502.  In the tree the Instance State Machine will
always show the phrase "Instance State Machine", but each event shown will have
a unique name found in SM_EVT.Mning.  Both of these nodes have their own icon
to be displayed next to their labels.


Instructions
------------
1) Open the sql/UITree.pei.sql file in your project
   If you don't have one, see the How to add a generated tree to a project.txt
   file in the com.mentor.nucleus.bp.ui.tree project.

*) Remember:
   The TNS statements are nodes in the tree that describe individual elements
   in the tree.  The TPS statements are parent sprecifications that hook up a
   parent node to a child node.  One parent node can have many children, but
   they would be listed in different TPS statements.  
   
   The 1st 2 parameters in the TPS statements refer to the 1st parameter in the
   TNS statements.  The 3rd parameter is the relationship(s) to traverse in the
   model that takes you from node 1 to node 2.


2) Create at least one new TNS statement for the node(s) you want to add.

3) Create a new TPS statement explaining where this node should show up in the
   tree.

4) Build the project.

The adapter for your new node will be automatically generated along with
everything else required to display your node in the tree.

Keep in mind however that the root adapter java file is not generated and may
need some modifying if you 

Enjoy.
