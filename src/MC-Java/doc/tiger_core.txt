Tiger Pre-Project Analysis, Design and Implementation Note
Metamodel Core

Abstract
========
This document describes the design and operation of the BridgePoint
Core Metamodel.

Background
==========
The Eclipse environment architecture encourages deployment of 
application functionality across multiple plugins. Usually there
is one 'master' plugin that contains functionality that supports
the operation of all the other plug-ins, which often add the UI
functionality needed to allow user interaction with the 
application.

This document describes what will goes into the core plugin for the
new toolsuite and how the plugins interact with the core to perform
the job of creating analyses in the form of UML diagrams and
generating code from those diagrams.

Analysis
========
The Eclipse article on resource change handling [1] gives a good 
example of how information about changes to resources (projects,
folders and files) is propagated to interested plugins in Eclipse.
Unfortunately, the mechanism is limited to the file system like 
components enumerated above. We would like to track changes at a
greater level of granularity than this; to components within a
given file.

Design
======
A new interface named IModelEntityChangeListener is added to the 
package com.mentor.nucleus.bp.core (at the same time this packaged is moved 
into its own plugin). Classes which require notification 
of changes to the model must implement this interface and
register with the metamodel using:

AddModelEntityChangeListener
                    (IModelEntityChangeListener newListener)

When notification is no longer required, the method:

RemoveModelEntityChangeListener
                     (IModelEntityChangeListener toRemove)

is used.

The IModelEntityChangeListener interface requires the
implementing class to implement a single method:
 
modelEntityChanged(IModelEntityChangeEvent event)

The IModelEntityChangeEvent interface requires the following
methods:

IModelEntityDelta getDelta() - returns a ModelEntityDelta, rooted
                               at the system level, describing the
                               set of changes that happened to 
                               entities in the system model.
IModelEntity getEntity()     - returns the entity in question.
Object getSource()           - returns an object identifying the 
                               source of this event.
int getType()                - returns the type of the event (see
                               IResourceChangeEvent for an 
                               enumeration and a definition of
                               the possible event types).

The IModelEntityDelta requires the implementation of the 
following methods:

int getKind()                - returns the kind of change made. 
                               Change types are ADDED, CHANGED, 
                               CONTENT, DESCRIPTION, ACTION_SEM,
                               MOVED_FROM, MOVED_TO, NO_CHANGE,
                               REMOVED, REPLACED, TYPE (see 
                               IResourceDelta for a definition 
                               of the meanings of these kind 
                               constants, except ACTION_SEM which
                               is similar to DESCRIPTION, but 
                               applies to the action semantics
                               field of the entity).
IModelEntityDelta[] getAffectedChildren() - returns an array of 
                               model entity deltas for all children
                               of this entity which were added,
                               removed or changed.
IModelEntity getEntity()     - returns a handle for the affected 
                               entity.

All the methods above are adapted from the IResourceDelta family
of Eclipse classes. They represent a subset of the methods defined
on those classes. Over time, a need for more of them may present 
itself.

The modelEntityChanged method is a callback. When it is invoked,
the receiver tests the event to see the kind of change and re-
renders itself based on the new state of the data in the metamodel.

Implementation
==============
IModelEntityChangeListener implementations envisaged immediately
are for ExplorerView and CanvasEditor.
