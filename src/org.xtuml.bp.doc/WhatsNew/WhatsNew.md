MASL Support Enhancements
------
This release includes many improvements in the convert/import/edit/export flow of MASL 
models:    

  * Support for concrete polymorphic events   
  * Support for recursive referential attributes
  * Enhancements to refactor/rename support
  * Updates to MASL templates and example projects
  * Support for pragmas on overloaded services
  * Greatly expanded model set used for MASL regression testing
  * ... and more.  See the full list of resolved issues in the Release Notes

This release also includes updated documentation in the MASL Modeling and Conversion Guide
regarding use and creation of MASL-idiom features.
  
Copy/Paste Improvements
------
Model element copy/paste was added to BridgePoint in version 5.8.  Usage of the new
functionality identified several issues that are addressed in this release:  

  * The graphics associated with model elements are now moved correctly in all cases     
  * Associations between shared classes may now be formalized    
  * Additional restrictions are added which disallow changes to parameters and return types in ports    
  * Enhanced support for moving elements under pessimistic locking revision control
