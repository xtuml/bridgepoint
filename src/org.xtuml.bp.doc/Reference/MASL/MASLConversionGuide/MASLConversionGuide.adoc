== Introduction

BridgePoint xtUML is designed to support the executable, translatable UML (xtUML) approach 
to the Shlaer-Mellor Method for Model-Driven Architecture (MDA). However, xtUML is not 
the only language to have its roots in this MDA approach. MASL  is another dialect that has 
evolved from the Shlaer-Mellor Method and developed a community of users. Now this 
common ancestry offers modelers in either community the potential to move models between 
the two dialects. 

BridgePoint xtUML is an editing and execution platform for xtUML 
modelers. With the addition of conversion tools, extensions to import/export facilities and 
a MASL-aware editor, BridgePoint xtUML is a platform for MASL modelers to advance 
their work and employ MASL downstream tools. When moving MASL models into xtUML, an idiom 
must be followed. This document details that idiom and the extensions to the platform that 
make working with MASL inside BridgePoint xtUML possible.

== Configuring the Workspace for MASL Modeling

MASL modeling places restrictions and adds features that are not present in OAL 
modeling with BridgePoint xtUML:

. Use MASL as the default action language 
. Enable restricted identifier naming for model elements 
. Allow concrete polymorphic events

The modeler may even wish to simplify the user interface to remove Palette and 
Context Menu Entries. link:../../UserInterface/PaletteAndContextMenuCustomization/PaletteAndContextMenuCustomization.html[Additional documentation] 
is available that describes how to perform this customization.

The MASL restrictions and features may be configured in the BridgePoint installation 
such that every workspace the modeler creates uses these settings.  This is generally 
the best approach.  To modify the defaults in the installation, a system administrator 
must locate and edit the `org.xtuml.bp.pkg_<version>/plugin_customization.ini` inside 
the installation. Change the settings to the values shown below.

If the settings are not applied in the installation, the settings may be applied all 
at once to the current workspace by importing the GPS Watch MASL example via 
*Help > Welcome > Quick Start > GPS Watch (MASL)*.  A dialog prompts to the user to 
enable the settings (<<wksp_setting>>).

=== Setting the Default Action Language 

For all workspaces via the installation INI file::

[source]
org.xtuml.bp.core/bridgepoint_prefs_default_action_language_dialect=1

In the current workspace via the UI::

MASL modelers need to set the default action language for the workspace to be
`MASL` instead of `OAL` using the Default Action Language preferences (<<al_pref>>). 
The preference is located under *Window > Preferences > xtUML*, and after selecting 
the button next to desired editor, *<click> OK* to close the window.

.Action Language Preferences
image::images/al_pref.png[xtUML Action Language Preferences,id="al_pref",width=444]

=== Enabling Restricted Identifier Naming

This preference restricts element names to follow the BNF rule: 
`( Letter | '\_' )( Letter | Digit | '_' )*;`

Identifiers may only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. Spaces, 
hyphens, and other characters are not allowed. 

NOTE: User data types names are not restricted by this setting. Relaxing the rule
for UDTs allows the modeler to create special data types like `sequence of integer` 
and type references like `Tracking::GoalSpan`.

For all workspaces via the installation INI file::

[source]
org.xtuml.bp.core/bridgepoint_prefs_require_masl_style_identifiers=true

In the current workspace via the UI::

The preference is located under *Window > Preferences > xtUML* (<<xtuml_pref>>).

== The MASL-xtUML Modeling Idiom

To ensure that MASL models and their usage of bridging MASL project deployments are 
accurately represented in xtUML, a set of recommendations and restrictions must be followed. 
Collectively these form the MASL-xtUML modeling idiom and are the foundation for model 
representation and error-free MASL export with BridgePoint xtUML.  
  
Since MASL and xtUML are based on the Shlaer-­Mellor Method, the two languages are similar 
at the core. Consequently, most mappings between constructs in the two languages are 
straight­forward (e.g., MASL Object maps to xtUML Class) and are therefore not detailed 
here. However, each language has been extended differently, leading to some mappings that 
are less obvious. These differences are explained in the sections below.  
  
The idiom addresses four areas of concern: 

. Bridging between domains
. Model packaging to maintain visibility
. Type mapping 
. Polymorphic events

By following the practices outlined in the MASL-xtUML modeling idiom, models that 
start as MASL can be converted to xtUML, modified inside the xtUML Editor and 
exported back to textual MASL for processing by downstream tools.  
  
=== Maintaining MASL Bridging Flexibility Inside xtUML

Systems are typically constructed by connecting multiple MASL domains (xtUML components) 
using some form of bridging notation. Where MASL employs terminators and public domain services, 
xtUML uses interfaces consisting of interface operations and ports. 

==== Using Deployments to Connect Domains 

In xtUML, a special model element named "Deployment" is used to define inter-domain
bridging in a manner that is familiar to modelers with experience creating MASL Procs (projects)
in other methodologies. link:../../UserInterface/xtUMLModeling/ModelElements/Deployments/Deployments.html[Deployments
are described in detail in the reference documentation].
 
MASL-style bridging using Deployments provides flexibility in the way domains (components) 
can communicate. For example, a domain may use a subset of the services surfaced by 
another domain, and it may choose to refer to those services using names that are 
different than the domain providing them. Additionally, a forking bridge allows a domain to 
view as a single service two or more services provided by any number of MASL domains.  
  
==== Domain Services 

Each component representing a MASL domain sprouts a single provided interface containing an 
interface operation for each public service surfaced by the MASL domain as declared in the 
MASL domain interface file. This provided interface covers all incoming interface 
operations for the domain component.

MASL domain services are modeled in BridgePoint as a function inside 
a component and a matching operation in a provided interface on the component boundary. See 
`clear()` and `key()` of the calc domain in <<masl_svc>>. By convention, the port name and this 
provided interface are renamed by the modeler to match the component (MASL domain) name. 

.MASL Domain and Terminator Services in xtUML
image::images/function_terminator.png[MASL Functions and Terminators,id="masl_svc",width=75%]

The `Publish to interface...` tool is available on the context menu of functions shown in 
Model Explorer.  This tool helps the user keep the interface operations in synch with 
changes made to the signatures of the domain services.  The tool is described in more 
detail in link:../../UserInterface/BridgePointContextMenuTools/BridgePointContextMenuTools.html[BridgePoint Context Menu Tools].  

If there is a domain service without a matching provided operation, it represents a private 
domain service in MASL. Thus, the existence of a matching operation in the provided 
interface provides access to the corresponding domain service and therefore makes it 
public. Without a matching operation in the provided interface, a domain service is private    
to the domain.

==== Terminator Services 

MASL terminators and terminator services define the outbound messages a domain
calls to access functionality provided by other domains.  They are modeled in BridgePoint 
as a required interface implementing interface operations on the component boundary. 
See the "disp" terminator and the `error()` and `result()` terminator services in Figure 2.   
 
IMPORTANT: The dialect property of the domain services and terminator services are important. 
For a MASL domain, all provided operations should have dialect "None" and required 
operations (i.e. terminator services) should have dialect "MASL". The xtUML function inside
the component that implements the domain service has dialect "MASL".   


=== Packaging Rules for MASL Compatibility

==== Packaging Overview  

Under xtUML, model elements defined within one component have no knowledge or visibility of 
model elements (including types) defined within another component. This is different from 
MASL where public types defined within a MASL domain can be accessed by other MASL domains 
using a qualified name of the form `otherDomainName::someType`. The xtUML visibility
rules also affect interface messages (domain and terminator services).  

The MASL-to-xtUML conversion process packages a MASL domain as an xtUML component. 
Thus, the types defined within that MASL domain become invisible to other components 
of the system.  To deal with these differences in scoping, packaging rules in the 
organization of the model are needed to maintain system-wide visibility.     

==== Packaging Requirements 

All interface declarations and shared types, including types used on terminator services, 
must be packaged outside the component (MASL domain)  definitions.   

.Shared Types and Interfaces 
image::images/domain_setup.png[MASL Project Layout,id="shared_type",width=254,role=right]

Each MASL domain implemented as an xtUML model contains a top-level package.  This
package typically has the same name as the domain component inside. This 
package contains:  

* a single component definition representing the MASL domain  
* shared types and interface definitions associated with the MASL domain in a package named "Shared" 

Another top-level package may also be included that contains structural types and 
type references.  By convention, this package is named "types". 
  
To support system-side visibility, BridgePoint’s support for inter-project references 
(IPRs) is leveraged. The xtUML project in a workspace that contains a Deployment will 
enable IPRs and thus will gain access to the components, interfaces, and types shared 
by the domain projects in the workspace. IPRs should remain off for domain projects.

A typical xtUML project using this approach is illustrated in <<shared_type>>. Note that all 
shared types defined in the domain are contained within the `Shared` package associated 
with that domain and not inside the component representing the MASL domain.   

[TIP]
====
With BridgePoint xtUML, the conversion facility produces a single xtUML model file 
adhering to the packaging and naming scheme illustrated. Modelers are free to repackage 
and rename their models as they see fit, so long as these two conditions are met:  

. All elements shared among components are defined outside the components that refer to them  
. All elements associated with a MASL domain reside within the domain package for that 
MASL domain (i.e. are underneath the package that contains the domain component) or are inside
the domain component itself 
====
  
=== Managing Types

Types that a domain intends to make public to the outside world are created in the 
`Shared` package that is a sibling to the component (domain).  

Types that a domain intends to keep private from the outside world should be created in a 
package underneath (within) the component.   

When this idiom for packaging is used, the MASL export facility produces a MASL domain 
interface file (`<domain>.int`) that includes the shared types, domain services, and 
terminators of the domain.    
   
==== xtUML and MASL Type Mapping

The MASL type system does not align perfectly with that of xtUML. In some cases MASL
modelers will use core xtUML types.  In other cases, the user will create a new
User Defined Type (UDT) that represents a MASL core type. The recommended practice is
to put these created MASL types in the top-level `types` package of the model. 

IMPORTANT: MASL types created by the user generally have their core type set to be the UDT 
named `MASLtype`, which exists or is created by the modeler in a top level package 
named `types`. The core type of `MASLtype` must be `string`. The core type of a UDT is 
manipulated in the Properties view (<<masl_sdt>>) or via *<RMB> > Set Type...*. 

Modelers are encouraged to use xtUML native types when possible. However, for some 
MASL native types, collection types, constrained types, and type references the modeler
will create custom types in the xtUML model. 

.Recommended Type Mapping
[options="header"]
|===
| MASL type  | xtUML type recommendation                              
a| boolean    | Use native `boolean`
a| byte       | Create UDT with core type `integer`
a| character  | Create UDT with core type `integer`     
a| date       | Use native `date`
a| device     | Create UDT with core type `MASLtype`
a| duration   | Create UDT with core type `integer`     
a| event      | Create UDT with core type `inst<Event>`
a| integer    | Use native `integer`
a| long_integer | Create UDT with core type `integer`     
a| real       | Use native `real`
a| string     | Use native `string`
a| timer      | Create a UDT with core type `inst_ref<Timer>` 
a| timestamp  | Create UDT with core type `MASLtype`
a| void       | Use native `void`
a| wcharacter | Create UDT with core type `integer`     
a| wstring    | Create UDT with core type `string`     
|===
  
===== Enumerations

Enumeration data types in the MASL-xtUML modeling idiom are special. These may be
created either with the built-in "Enumeration Data Type (EDT)" model element or are 
defined in a textual MASL form. The MASL exporter creates legal MASL for both forms. 

The recommended practice is to use the built-in EDT model element. These are created
just like all other model elements using the Palette or the *New > Types* context menu.
The enumerator values are added via the context menu.  

Alternatively, to create a textual MASL definition for an enumeration data type:

. Create a new User Data Type in the desired package and name it appropriately
. Set the Core Type property of the new UDT to `MASLtype`
. <dbl-click> on the new type or use the `...` button in the Properties view to open the 
Data Type Definition editor
. Write MASL to define the type. An examples is shown in <<masl_enum>>.

.MASL Enumeration Data Type
image::images/masl_enum.png[MASL Enumeration Data Type,id="masl_enum", width=75%] 

===== Structures 

Structured data types in the MASL-xtUML modeling idiom are also special. These MASL 
types are defined exclusively in a textual form and do not use the "Structured Data Type" 
element that is built into BridgePoint xtUML.

To create a structured data type for use in a MASL model:

. Create a new User Data Type in the desired package and name it appropriately
. Set the Core Type property of the new UDT to `MASLtype`
. <dbl-click> on the new type or use the `...` button in the Properties view to open the 
Data Type Definition editor
. Write MASL to define the type. An example is shown in <<masl_sdt>>.

.MASL Structured Data Type
image::images/masl_structure.png[MASL Structured Data Type,id="masl_sdt",width=75%] 

==== Type References

In xtUML typing is established through a link between the model element being typed and a 
particular instance of a type. However, MASL treats a type reference as a first ­class 
concept which makes typing a model element in MASL slightly more complex than it is with 
xtUML. This is because a type reference in MASL can further constrain the type that is 
applied to the affected model element. Type references may be used to type structural 
model elements or variable declarations inside MASL activities.  

Type references must be used to add constraints to types, use collection types, or instance 
types. To use these types, create a new public User Data Type type and enter the full 
type reference as the type name. Then use the Properties view (<<conf_type_ref>>) or 
*<RMB> > Set Type...* to set the core type of the new UDT to `MASLtype`.

For example, the modeler can create a new UDT and name it `sequence of integer`.  Model 
elements, such as parameters or class attributes, may be set to this new type and used 
in MASL action language inside the model.

.Configuring Type References in Properties
image::images/typerefs.png[Configuring Type References in Properties,id="conf_type_ref",width=75%] 

Type references may be placed either in the top level `types` package of the project
or in the `Shared` package next to the domain.  It is left to the modeler's judgement  
to determine if it makes better sense to place the type reference close to 
the domain or at the system-level. 

NOTE: MASL allows modelers to constrain sequence types with a max size. Only integer 
literals are allowed to be used to constrain sequences when the type is used to type an 
activity parameter or a return type. If the type is used to type a local variable, an 
attribute, or a structure member, any constant expression of type integer may be used in 
a sequence constraint.

==== Using Shared Types

To access shared types from other domains in MASL action language, the modeler must create 
a dependency to the `<other domain>.int` file into the local project's 
link:../../UserInterface/xtUMLModeling/Preferences/ProjDependencies.html[Dependencies project preferences].  

.Shared Types in a Deployment
image::images/gps_typerefs.png[Type References in GPS_Watch,id="depl_shared_type",width=226,role=right] 

To access shared types from other domains in the structural part of the model, the modeler 
must create a type reference in the local xtUML project (<<depl_shared_type>>).  This action is completed by 
creating a new UDT in the current project with a special name that references the 
domain where the type actually lives (e.g. `OtherDom::someType`).  It is recommended 
that these type reference UDTs be created inside the `Shared` package that is a sibling 
to the component or deployment that uses the type reference.  

The MASL version GPS Watch example application shows shared types (via type references)
in action inside the `GPS_Watch` project. Each shared type, such as `Tracking::GoalCriteria`, 
is a user data type whose core type is set to `MASLtype`. 

=== Polymorphic Events

In the MASL idiom events in a subtype/supertype hierarchy take a "concrete polymorphic" 
rather than an "abstract polymorphic" semantic.  In the concreate semantic, polymorphic 
events must be processed at each level of the class hierarchy.  

Each state machine up and down the generalization must explicitly assign the polymorphic 
event to a transition or establish the event as `Event Ignored` or as `Can't Happen`. 
The default value is `Can't Happen`. To select the desired behavior for an event sent
to a state, open the state machine canvas then select the `State Event Matrix` tab
at the bottom of the canvas. The desired behavior may now be selected from the dropdown
list associated with each cell of the matrix.

Polymorphic events are shown in Model Explorer in the form `<event name>::<supertype name>`.


== Special MASL Constructs in xtUML  

=== Deferred Operations

To create a deferred operation, create an operation with an identical signature in each 
subtype class.  Then use the Properties view to set the dialect of the supertype class' 
operation to "None".  Each subtype class' operation dialect is set to "MASL".  

=== Accessing Service Domains

To access shared implementations from service domains the modeler must create a dependency 
to the `<other domain>.int` file or a folder containing one or more `<other domain>.int` 
files in the local project's link:../../UserInterface/xtUMLModeling/Preferences/ProjDependencies.html[Dependencies project preferences].   

When a folder dependency is specified, all MASL `*.int` files directly under the folder are 
parsed as part of the local project's validation process.  

=== Marking

Application marks are used to control and customize the model translation 
process.  They allow the modeler to provide values for pre-defined features
of the model compiler.  

The MASL model compiler takes this input in the form of `pragma` statements
associated with application model element.  The marks created using this marking
editor are output as `pragma`s when the modeler exports MASL.

link:../../UserInterface/MarkingEditor/MarkingEditor.html[Additional documentation] 
describes the process of marking a MASL model in full detail.

== BridgePoint Extensions for MASL

The MASL extensions added to BridgePoint include: 

. MASL-xtuml conversion tools 
. Enhanced BridgePoint Import/Export facilities
. MASL-aware Editor  

Each of these enhanced facilities are described in the sections below.  

=== MASL Model Conversion

The conversion of MASL domains into MASL-infused xtUML models is 
performed by the tool `masl2xtuml` and is invoked from the command line. The conversion 
command `masl2xtuml`  has the following syntax for MASL domains:  

`masl2xtuml -d <directory path> -o <directory path>`  
  
where `<directory path>` is any relative or absolute directory path, `-d` identifies 
the MASL domain and `-o` identifies the destination directory where the xtUML model 
file is written to. A complete link:../masl2xtuml/masl2xtuml.html[reference is included in the MASL documentation].
   
The MASL domains are processed one at a time in any order. All conversion 
can be performed sequentially or each conversion can be followed by a BridgePoint model 
import. 
    
Note that MASL domain models can be converted and imported into the workspace in any 
order. 
   
=== MASL Import Extension

The xtUML Import wizard is extended to handle MASL models that have been converted to
xtUML.  

As described earlier, the MASL-xtUML idiom organizes the BridgePoint workspace based on 
projects, and an xtUML project is needed for each MASL domain and MASL project. 

It is important to recall that the MASL-xtUML idiom requires system-wide scope for some 
model elements and this is facilitated in BridgePoint using Inter-Project References. 
This feature is only used for xtUML projects that hold deployments. xtUML projects
that contain MASL domains do not use IPRs.

==== BridgePoint Model Import from the xtUML Modeling Perspective

To perform each import from inside BridgePoint, the xtUML Modeling perspective is used following these 
steps:   
   
. Create an xtUML project using *File > New > xtUML Project*. This command will ask for 
a name which must be unique among all projects in the workspace. A descriptive name that 
includes a connection to the original MASL domain is suggested. Choose "MASL Exporter" 
on the model compiler selection page.
. Select *File > Import* to start a model import. This will open the Import wizard.
. Expand the xtUML folder and select xtUML Model from the list of import sources.
. After *<click>* ing on Next, enter the full path to the MASL-infused xtUML model file 
to be imported. Pressing the Browse button will open a file browser where *<click>* s are 
used to navigate through the folder list down to the file to be imported.
. Once the path is entered, *<click>* Finish to initiate the import.
. Upon completion, the Model Explorer view will be updated to show the newly imported 
model.
   
=== MASL Export Extension

The conversion of xtUML models to MASL is a single step operation that is invoked from 
either the xtUML Modeling perspective or a command line. The MASL Export extension consists 
of the `xtuml2masl` conversion tool and enhancements to the BridgePoint "Build Project"
facility to support the translation of the model into MASL.   

==== MASL Export from the xtUML Modeling Perspective

The configuration to export an xtUML model to MASL from BridgePoint typically occurs
during project creation.  When a new xtUML Project is created a wizard guides the user through the
model creation process.  After giving the project a name, the user must select "MASL Exporter" 
as the model compiler to use.

At any point during the modeling process the user may select *<RMB> > Build Project* 
(or the hammer button in the toolbar).
This action will cause the model to be translated from xtUML to MASL.  The output is
placed in a folder underneath the project on disk.  The default name of the folder is
`masl/`, but it may be configured in the MASL Exporter properties (<<masl_exp_prop>>).  To
access these properties, select the project in Model Explorer, then use the menu 
*Project > Properties*.  Open the "Navigator"
view or switch to the "C/C++" perspective to use a file browser inside the tool. 
 
.MASL Exporter Properties 
image::images/masl_exporter_properties.png[MASL Exporter Properties,id="masl_exp_prop",width=500]

If an xtUML project already exists that is not configured to use this MASL Exporter, 
a tool is available to convert the project to use it.  To access this tool, select 
the xtUML project in Model Explorer, then *<RMB> > BridgePoint Utilities > Set Model 
Compiler* and choose MASL Exporter from the list.
 
==== MASL Export from the Command line

To export xtUML models to MASL equivalent models without invoking the BridgePoint UI, the 
`xtuml2masl` tool is used.
It is recommended that all xtUML projects be contained in a single workspace, 
however this is not enforced by the export tool.
  
To invoke the MASL export tool, the following syntax is used  

[source]
xtuml2masl -i <eclipse project path> -d <package name> [-o <output directory> ] 
  or
xtuml2masl -i <eclispe project path> -p <package name> [-o <output directory> ]

See the `xtuml2masl` link:../xtuml2masl/xtuml2masl.html[reference page in BridgePoint Help] 
for complete details. Note, if the `-o` parameter is omitted, the current directory is used 
by default.  

=== MASL Editor Extensions

Once a MASL model has been imported as an xtUML project, BridgePoint extensions for MASL 
are accessed through the xtUML Modeling perspective. These extensions to the perspective 
enable MASL-aware code editing and MASL export.   
  
To best support MASL, the extensions to BridgePoint xtUML include a full featured code 
editor with MASL syntax highlighting and content assistance.   

The editor will appear when a model element containing MASL is *<dbl-click>* or 
when using *<RMB> > Open With > MASL Editor*.     

==== Inter-Project References and MASL

IPRs are a mechanism for xtUML model elements defined in one xtUML project to be used 
in another xtUML project. For the access to be allowed, the referring project must have 
IPRs enabled.  
    
To check if IPRs are enabled for a particular xtUML project, select that project in the 
Model Explorer View and then select *<RMB> > Properties*. This will open a 
popup window (<<proj_pref>>).  Selecting `xtUML Project > Inter-project References` will show the setting 
"Allow inter-project model references". The use of IPRs is enabled if the checkbox is 
marked.   

.Properties
image::images/image01.png[xtUML Project Preferences,id="proj_pref",width=50%] 

For the models based on the MASL-xtUML idiom, all xtUML projects containing a MASL 
domain component must have this checkbox *unchecked*.  

Those xtUML projects containing a Deployment must have this checkbox *checked* to
use the `Import terminators from component...` feature.  The tool provides a user-assistance 
feature for these projects that contain Deployments. It will prompt the user and 
automatically turn on IPRs for the project when performing `Import terminators from component...` 
on a Deployment with IPRs turned off.  

Project that contain deployments do not need to have IPRs turned on in order to use
the `Import terminators from file...` feature.
