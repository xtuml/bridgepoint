= Command Line Interface

The Command Line Interface (CLI) provides a mechanism to automate the execution
and translation of xtUML projects. The CLI supports Import, Build and Execute
tasks using the following command structure:

`CLI <Build | Import | Execute | Merge> <Argument List>`

where `<Argument List>` depends on the task.
Further details on the options available for each CLI task can be found by
entering `CLI <Build | Import | Execute | Merge> -help`

== Preparing a Project to be Used With CLI
Prior to invoking the CLI, assign the proper value to the WORKSPACE environment
variable in the launch terminal.footnote:[You can also modify the value CLI.sh
in the <BridgePoint install>/tools/mc/bin/CLI.sh file.]

For each target project, launch and build configurations are required under the
following circumstances:

. For the `Build` task, a build configuration must exist for each name requested
by option `-buildConfig`
. For the `Execute` task, a launch configuration must exist for each name
requested by option `-launch` and each configuration must identify at least one
`Initializer`.footnote:[an interface operation, interface signal or state
machine event.]

_It is recommended that the `Execution timeout (seconds)` selection be set to a
value greater than 0, so if the execution time exceeds this limit, execution
will terminate with a timeout error message._

== Building a Project Using the CLI
The Build task, `CLI Build <Argument List>`, is used to translate an xtUML
model using the project’s selected model compiler.

`<Argument List>` can contain any of the following options:

|===
|Parameter | Description

| -project <name> | The name of the project to be built.
| -buildConfig <name> | The name of the CDT build configuration to be used.
footnote:[If omitted then the current Active configuration is used.]
| -prebuildOnly | Only execute the BridgePoint Model Compiler pre-builder.
| -doNotParse footnote:[Only applies if -prebuildOnly is used.] | Do not parse
the model during this build process.
| -cleanCLI | Perform a clean build of the project.
| -debugCLI | Launch a workbench and leave it open after execution.
| -help | Display usage information.
|===

== Importing a Project Using the CLI
The Import task, `CLI Import <Argument List>`, is used to add the named project
to the current workspace.

`<Argument List>` can contain any of the following options:

|===
| Parameter | Description

| -project <directory> | The fully qualified path of the project to be imported.
| -deleteExisting | Delete an existing project with the same name in the
workspace before importing the named project.
| -file <file> | The fully qualified path of an xtUML file to import.
| -targetProject <name> | The desired name of the imported project in the
workspace.footnote:[If omitted, the project name will be set to be the name of
the project or xtUML filename being imported.]
| -workingPath <directory> | The fully qualified path to the storage location of
the project files.
| -help | Display usage information.
|===

== Executing a Project Using the CLI
The Execute task, `CLI Execute <Argument List>`, is used to run an xtUML model
using BridgePoint’s xtUML Debugging perspective.

`<Argument List>` can contain any of the following options:

|===
| Parameter | Description

| -launch <name> | The name of the launch configuration to execute.
| -debugCLI | Launch a workbench and leave it open after execution.
| -help | Display usage information.
|===

== Merging Changes From a Remote Version into the Local Project Using the CLI
The Merge task, `CLI Merge <Argument List>`, is used to produce an xtUML model
file containing the merged resultant from two xtUML model files, that are
derived from a common ancestor.

`<Argument List>` can contain any of the following options:

|===
| Parameter | Description

| -rightFile <file> | The name of the remote file to be used in the merge.
| -leftFile <file> | The name of the local file to be used in the merge.
| -ancestorFile <file> | The name of the common ancestor to both `rightFile`
and `leftFile`.
| -outputFile <file> | The name of the file to hold the resultant of the merge.
| -help | Display usage information.
|===

_The Merge task will fail and no output file generated, if conflicts exist
between the left file and the right file. Also, an absolute path must be
specified for the left, right, ancestor and output files._

== Suggestions for Troubleshooting CLI Problems
These suggestions are intended for problems involving scripts that interact with
usage of the CLI script. The combination of these suggestions is often
sufficient to isolate and correct CLI problems.

. Interactively, repeat the scripted steps inside the tool GUI. The information
contained in the console window can assist in isolating the problem and
confirming whether the issue relates to the CLI script or other aspects of the
scripted process.
. If confirmed that the issue is a CLI script problem, modify the `eclipsec`
invocation inside the CLI script to add `-debug -console -consoleLog` to the
command just before `-application` and re-run the script. These additional
settings will present extra debugging detail in the console output.
. For further debugging, add `-debugCLI` to suspected CLI commands. The
`-debugCLI` option is analogous to a breakpoint at the end of the CLI command
that will leave the eclipse workbench open for further interactive probing.

== CLI Examples Using the GPS Watch Project
Here is a simple script that will:footnote:[Location path for CLI.sh omitted for
brevity.]
. Import the GPS Watch project from `$HOME/temp` into `$WORKSPACE`.
. Build the project as a `Debug` configuration.
. Execute the project using the `GPS_Watch_test` debug configuration.

....
CLI.sh Import -deleteExisting -project $HOME/temp/GPS_Watch

CLI.sh Build -project GPS_Watch -buildConfig Debug -cleanCLI

CLI.sh Execute -launch "`GPS Watch With Initializer`"
....

If the GPS Watch project, located at `$WORKSPACE/GPS_Watch/model.xtuml`, is
modified and stored as two projects, `$WORKSPACE/GPS1` and `$WORKSPACE/GPS2`,
then a merged file named, `model.xtuml` can be produced from this CLI command:

....
CLI.sh Merge -leftFile $WORKSPACE/GPS1/model.xtuml \
-rightFile $WORKSPACE/GPS2/model.xtuml \
-ancestorFile $WORKSPACE/GPS_Watch/model.xtuml \
-outputFile $WORKSPACE/GPS_merge/model.xtuml
....
