= Relationships

== Relationship Specifications

A relationship specification identifies exactly which relationship is 
required to be created, navigated, or deleted.

=== Syntax

----
R<number>
r<number>
R<number>.<relationship phrase> 
r<number>.<relationship phrase>
----

`+<number>+` is the number of the relationship as 
shown on the class diagram (e.g., R1). 

`+<relationship phrase>+` is the text that appears at the destination 
end of the relationship, enclosed in tick marks and contained on a single line.

=== Note

Either `+R+` or `+r+` may be used when referring to a relationship.

=== Examples

----
r5
R10.'owns'
r10.'is owned by'
R22.'uses'
R1.'Is rotated by'
R1.'Contains'
R2.'Is assigned to'
----

== Creating an Instance of a Relationship

=== Syntax

----
relate <source instance handle> to <destination instance handle> across <relationship specification>; 

relate <source instance handle> to <destination instance handle> across <relationship specification> using <associative instance handle>; 
----

`+<source instance handle>+` is the handle of the first class instance to be related.

`+<destination instance handle>+` is the handle of the second class instance to be related.

`+<relationship specification>+` is the specification of the relationship from the source class to the destination class. This can be any of the forms described in the previous section.

`+<associative instance handle>+` is the handle of an existing class instance that is used as the associative class instance for this relationship instance.

=== Notes

The relationship specification should be framed as if navigating from source class to destination class.

The source, destination, and associative instance handles may be `+self+`.

If an attempt is made to relate two instances via the same relationship more than once, this is regarded as a run time error by the BridgePoint Verifier unless the relationship is (M:M)-M.

The `+using <associative instance>+` form is used when an associative relationship is being instantiated. The associative instance must have already been created before the relationship is instantiated.

=== Examples

----
select any dp_inst from instances of DP;
select any d_inst from instances of D;
relate dp_inst to d_inst across R1;
 
 
select any a_inst from instances of A;
select any b_inst from instances of B;
create object instance c_inst of C;
relate a_inst to b_inst across R1 using c_inst;
 
 
// State 3. "Assigning Probe to Row"
select any row from instances of ROW
  where ( selected.needs_probe == true );
select any probe from instances of SP
  where ( selected.available == true );
probe.available = false;
row.needs_probe = false;
create object instance assignment of PA;
relate row to probe across R2 using assignment;
generate PA_A3:probe_assigned() to PA class;
generate ROW2:probe_assigned() to row;
----

== Deleting an Instance of a Relationship

=== Syntax

----
unrelate <source instance handle> from <destination instance handle> across <relationship specification>;

unrelate <source instance handle> from <destination instance handle> across <relationship specification> using <associative instance handle>;
----

`+<source instance handle>+` is the handle of the first class instance to be unrelated.

`+<destination instance handle>+` is the handle of the second class instance to be unrelated.

`+<relationship specification>+` is the specification of the relationship from the source to the destination class.

`+<associative instance handle>+` is the handle of the associative class instance that captures the relationship instance.

=== Notes

The relationship specification should be framed as if navigating from the source class to the destination class.

An attempt to unrelate two instances that are not related by the specified relationship is regarded as a run time error by the BridgePoint Verifier.

The source, destination, and associative instance handles may be `+self+`.

If an associative relationship is unrelated then the associative class instance(s) will not be deleted. The analyst must specify this explicitly.

If an unconditional relationship is deleted, instances of participating classes will not automatically be deleted to remain consistent 
with the Class Diagram. It is the responsibility of the analyst to ensure that 
the Class Diagram is respected. This applies equally to super/subtype relationships.

=== Examples

----
unrelate a_inst from b_inst across R1;
unrelate a_inst from b_inst across R1 using c_inst;
delete object instance c_inst;
----

== Relationship Navigation

Relationship navigation is the function whereby relationships specified on 
the Class Diagram are read in order to determine the instance or set of 
instances that are related to an instance of interest.

=== Syntax

----
select one <instance handle> related by <start> -> <relationship link> -> ... <relationship link>;

select any <instance handle> related by <start> -> <relationship link> -> ... <relationship link>;

select many <instance handle set> related by <start> -> <relationship link> -> ... <relationship link>;

select one <instance handle> related by <start> -> <relationship link> -> ... <relationship link> where <where expression>;

select any <instance handle> related by <start> -> <relationship link> -> ... <relationship link> where <where expression>;

select many <instance handle set> related by <start> -> <relationship link> -> ... <relationship link> where <where expression>;
----

`+<start>+` is an `+<instance handle set>+` or `+<instance handle>+` obtained from a previous select statement.

`+<relationship link>+` is a `+<keyletter>[<relationship specification>]+` , where the square brackets are literal 
and do not indicate optional text.

`+<keyletter>+` is the keyletter of the class reached by the specified relationship.

`+<relationship specification>+` is the specification of the relationship from the source to the destination class.

`+<where expression>+` is a type of boolean expression using the `+selected+` keyword.

=== Notes

A relationship link chain is the sequence of `+<relationship link>+` 's used to specify the path 
from the starting instance or set of instances to the destination.

Use the `+select one+` form if at most one instance handle can be returned by navigating 
the relationship link chain.

Use the `+select any+` or `+select many+` form if more than one instance handle 
can be returned by navigating the relationship link chain. `+select any+` returns 
a single instance, and `+select many+` returns all instances that meet the 
selection criteria.

The `+select any+` form returns the instance handle of an arbitrary instance of 
the class at the end of the relationship link chain.

The `+select many+` form returns an instance handle set containing all the 
instances of the class at the end of the relationship link chain.

The `+select any ... where+` form returns the instance handle of an arbitrary 
instance of the class at the end of the relationship link chain that fulfills 
the `+<where expression>+` criteria.

The `+select many ... where+` form returns an instance handle set containing 
all the instances of the class at the end of the instance chain that fulfill 
the `+<where expression>+` criteria.

The relationship phrases in the relationship link chain must be given in the 
direction of navigation.

If the starting `+<instance handle>+` or `+<instance handle set>+` is empty, 
then the result is guaranteed to be empty.

The returned `+<instance handle>+` or `+<instance handle set>+` can be empty 
if any of the relationships in the chain are conditional in the direction of 
navigation.

If the optional `+where+` clause is added, the returned instance or set of 
instances will meet the criteria of `+<where expression>+` . This implies 
that the returned `+<instance handle>+` or `+<instance handle set>+` may be 
empty if no instance(s) matched.

=== Example I

----
select one cat related by owner->C[R1];
select any dog related by owner->D[R2];
select many dogs related by owner->D[R2];
 
select any assignment from instances of PA here ( selected.probe_ID == self.probe_ID );
select any dog related by owner->D[R2] where ( selected.name == "Fido" );
select many dogs related by owner->D[R2] where selected.color == "black";
----

=== Example II

----
select any student from instances of STU;
select many major_courses_offered related by student->PROF[R34]->DEPT[R23]->COUR[R40];
----

==  Asymmetric Reflexive Relationship

An asymmetric reflexive relationship is a powerful construct for expressing many 
different common abstractions.  However, the syntax for establishing, removing, 
and traversing links across these relationships is not always intuitive.  
Examples follow.

=== Simple Asymmetric Reflexive

Consider the class model below with three instances of 
`+LaneBoundary+`:  `+leftMost+`, `+middle+`, and `+rightMost+`.

image::simple_asymm_reflex.png[]

The following actions relate the instances appropriately:

----
relate leftMost to middle across R2.'is left of and adjacent to';
relate rightMost to middle across R2.'is right of and adjacent to';
----

The following actions find instances correctly, although that may 
not appear obvious at first glance; remember, the middle lane boundary 
is to the _right_ of the leftmost one.

----
select one leftMost related by middle->LaneBoundary[R2.'is right of and adjacent to'];
select one rightMost related by middle->LaneBoundary[R2.'is left of and adjacent to'];
select one middle related by leftMost->LaneBoundary[R2.'is left of and adjacent to'];
select one middle related by rightMost->LaneBoundary[R2.'is right of and adjacent to']
----

The following actions unrelate the instances as expected:

----
unrelate leftMost from middle across R2.'is left of and adjacent to';
unrelate rightMost from middle across R2.'is right of and adjacent to';
----

=== Associative Asymmetric Reflexive

Consider the class model below with three instances of 
`+LaneBoundary+`:  `+leftMost+`, `+middle+`, and `+rightMost+`, 
and two instances of `+Lane+`: `+left+` and `+right+`.

image::assoc_asymm_reflex.png[]

The following actions relate the instances appropriately:

----
relate leftMost to middle across R2.'is left of and adjacent to' using left;
relate rightMost to middle across R2.'is right of and adjacent to' using right;
----

Traversing from one instance of `+LaneBoundary+` to another is done in the 
same way as for the simple asymmetric reflexive case. The following actions 
traverse from instances of `+Lane+` to instances of `+LaneBoundary+`:

----
select one leftMost related by left->LaneBoundary[R2.'is right of and adjacent to'];
select one middle related by left->LaneBoundary[R2.'is left of and adjacent to'];
select one middle related by right->LaneBoundary[R2.'is right of and adjacent to'];
select one rightMost related by right->LaneBoundary[R2.'is left of and adjacent to'];
----

And, these actions traverse from instances of `+LaneBoundary+` to instances 
of `+Lane+`:

----
select one left related by leftMost->Lane[R2.'is left of and adjacent to'];
select one left related by middle->Lane[R2.'is right of and adjacent to'];
select one right related by middle->Lane[R2.'is left of and adjacent to'];
select one right related by rightMost->Lane[R2.'is right of and adjacent to'];
----

The following actions unrelate the instances as expected:

----
unrelate leftMost from middle across R2.'is left of and adjacent to' using left;
unrelate rightMost from middle across R2.'is right of and adjacent to' using right;
----

=== Remembering the Syntax

The `+relate+` and `+unrelate+` statements follow a pattern of `+<firstHandle> 
<phrase> <secondHandle>+`:

----
relate leftMost to middle across R2.'is left of and adjacent to';
unrelate rightMost from middle across R2.'is right of and adjacent to';
----

The `+select+` statement follows a pattern of `+<secondHandle> <phrase> <firstHandle>+`.
In the examples below, `+leftMost+`, `+middle+`, and `+rightMost+` are instances of 
`+LaneBoundary+` while `+right+` is an instance of `+Lane+`:

----
select one leftMost related by middle->LaneBoundary[R2.'is right of and adjacent to'];
select one rightMost related by right->LaneBoundary[R2.'is left of and adjacent to'];
select one right related by middle->Lane[R2.'is left of and adjacent to'];
----

It may be useful to visualize the decomposed version of a reflexive relationship 
when trying to determine which phrase to use.

image::split_assoc.png[]

In the decomposed class diagram, it is easy to see that to find an instance 
of a `+LeftLaneBoundary+`, given an instance of a `+RightLaneBoundary+` or an 
instance of a `+Lane+`, the `+select+` statement must employ 
the `+‘is right of and adjacent to’+` phrase.  Similarly, finding an 
instance of a `+RightLaneBoundary+`, given an instance of `+LeftLaneBoundary+` 
or an instance of `+Lane+` requires the `+‘is left of and adjacent to’+` phrase.
