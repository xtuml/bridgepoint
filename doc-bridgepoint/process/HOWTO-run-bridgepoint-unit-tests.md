# HOWTO Run the BridgePoint Unit Tests
This document provides the information required to run the BridgePoint development unit tests.  

Preparation 
-----------
1) See the [Developer Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/xtuml/bridgepoint/blob/master/doc-bridgepoint/process/Developer%20Getting%20Started%20Guide.md) for getting the proper environment set for running the BridgePoint development unit tests.  

2) This document uses ```~/git``` as the root folder for git repostiories, and it uses ```~/workspace``` as the development workspace. You may substitute any folder you desire, but you must be consistent.

3) Create a launcher. e.g.,```~/BridgePoint/Launcher.sh``` in a text editor (or in Windows Launcher.bat)

- Add the following lines (on Windows substitute "set" for "export"):  
```
#!/bin/sh
export XTUML_DEVELOPMENT_REPOSITORY=~/git/bridgepoint
export XTUML_TEST_MODEL_REPOSITORY=~/git/models/test/
export XTUML_PRIVATE_MODEL_REPOSITORY=~/git/modelsmg/test/
~/BridgePoint/bridgepoint
```

- This launcher must be used to start BridgePoint for unit testing.

4) Import the unit test projects into the same workspace set up in the [Developer Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/xtuml/bridgepoint/blob/master/doc-bridgepoint/process/Developer%20Getting%20Started%20Guide.md)
- Import existing projects from the **bptest** repository into your workspace.
- __WARNING!:__ Ensure "Search for nested projects" is Unchecked.  

5) If you want to run BridgePoint unit tests on MS Windows you must perform some additional steps [described here.](https://github.com/xtuml/bridgepoint/blob/master/doc-bridgepoint/process/FAQ.md#windowstesting) 

Instructions
------------
In normal testing, **Run** is used to best simulate a runtime environment, while **Debug** is used to set breakpoints and debug the runtime environment.
- Select **Run > Run Configurations...**, and note the following:
  - Section **Eclipse Application** contains the launchers for the BridgePoint builds
    - The **BP Application** launchers are for Windows.
    - The **x BP Application** launchers are for Linux.
    - **CLI** launchers are for the command line interface.
  - Section **JUnit Plug-in Test** contains the individual launchers for the defined BridgePoint plug-in unit tests.
  - Section **Launch Group** has a member called **BridgePoint Unit Tests**, which will launch all of the JUint plug-in tests.
- To run the standard unit test suite, select the **Launch Group > BridgePoint Unit Tests** configuration.
  - This will show a tabbed window with the **Launches** tab selected.
    - The window contains a list of JUnit plug-in tests with checkboxes.
  - Select the **Run** button to launch the tests.
    - This will cause each selected test in the **Launches** tab to be executed.
    - The builder will build BridgePoint, if necessary, and launch the build as the test target. Since all tests are being run, the execution will take a while.
    - A summary of the results of the tests can be found in < BridgePoint installation >/eclipse/test_results/unit_test_summary.txt. The creation of this document is implemented in the org.xtuml.bp.test plugin.

### If a test fails or you need to debug the test failure
1. Try running the test individually by selecting **Run > Run Configurations... > JUnit Plug-in Test** and selecting the test.
2. To debug the test, select **Debug > Debug Configurations... > JUnit Plug-in Test** and select the test to debug.
3. Set breakboints in the generated or realized BridgePoint java source code in your host environment as needed.
