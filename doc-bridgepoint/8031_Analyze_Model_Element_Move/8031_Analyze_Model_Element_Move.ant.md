# Model element move
### xtUML Project Analysis Note

1. Abstract
-----------
This note analyzes the different approaches to providing a model element move.   
It considers the current approach and offers other potential approaches.

3. Background
-------------   
The original work to provide cut copy and paste was done such that all actions
used as much as the same code as possible.  The idea at the time was that a cut   
was simply a copy with the addition of a delete.  Later a move operation was    
required.  At the time the easiest approach was to use the existing    
infrastructure while adding referring element proxies to the copied data.   

This approach does not provide an atomic operation for a move.  This leads to   
requiring a user to undo a paste as well as the cut to return the model from a   
move.   

Another issue with this approach is that when a cut is performed the pasted   
result has element IDs updated.  This is due to sharing code between copy and   
cut and is not a true move.   

Proxies are complete replicas of the original element.  We use them to allow   
resolution during load of referring elements.  They are also used to access   
data during compare and merge.  Proxies are mantained at all times and   
represent the exact model element data at the last save.  In the case of   
referring proxy data we only use this during the cut and paste functionality.   

The tools file structure completely matches the model structure.   

BridgePoint was designed to search for an element first by name during   
resolution, then check for an element by ID.   

The following lists the current approach of copy cut and paste:   

- copy (text version of the model is added to the OS clipboard)   
- cut (text version of the model is added to the OS clipboard, data is   
  deleted in the model)
- paste (data is inspected and connected if possible)   

4. Requirements
---------------
4.1 Element move shall be supported as an atomic operation.  
4.2 A single undo shall replace changes from an element move.    
4.3 Moving any visible referred to element shall result in reconnection with any   
    referring elements.  
4.4 Moving any referring elements shall result in reconnection to the referred   
    to element if visible.  
4.5 The elements to be supported shall be:   
    - For referred to elements:    
      - Datatype   
      - Interface   
      - Component   
      - Executable Property   
      - Interface Reference   
      - Port   
    - For referring elements all shall be supported       
4.6 The move operation shall only be enabled when a valid target is selected.   
4.7 The move operation shall adhere to all eclipse team interface rules.   
4.8 The work shall be done in a configuration management friendly system manner,   
    but must not violate the eclipse team interface rules.   

5. Analysis
-----------
5.1 Supporting move as an atomic action  

One approach to supporting move as an atomic action is to introduce a context   
menu item for move.  This action shall use the existing infrastructure in a   
similar manner to the existing cut and paste approach.  It shall capture the   
changes in a single transaction.   

This approach would address the undo issue.   

In this case we shall modify the export code to only update the IDs when   
performing a copy.  A flag that shall be set during cut shall indicate the cut
operation and prevent updating of the IDs.   

5.2 Using eclipse file infrastructure   

Another approach which may address configuration management issues is to move   
folders or files directly.  This can be done with the eclipse API but would   
require quite a bit more work.   

This approach would require a move operation as 5.1 does.  The operation though   
would simply locate the file or folder of the element and move it.  This would   
then require additional file change listeners or require updating the existing   
ones that we have.  The changes would require us to hear the change then fix the   
element data in memory and persist.   

5.3 Existing infrastructure  

Another approach is to remain simply with cut and paste.  In this case the tool   
shall be updated to prevent updating IDs in the same manner as described above    
in 5.1.   

In this case the operation would be a move but would not be atomic.   

6. Work Required
----------------
6.1 Supporting move as an atomic action   
6.1.1 New move operation using existing infrastructure   
6.1.1.2 Introduce a new menu item   
6.1.1.3 Create a dialog that allows destination selection    
6.1.1.3.1 Allow the dialog to filter locations by type   
6.1.1.2.1 Have the menu item call an operation that performs a cut and paste in   
          a single transaction    
6.1.1.3 Modify export and paste code to only modify IDs on copy   
6.2 Using eclipse file infrastructure
6.2.1 Create new move operation which locates the element's file or folder and   
      call into the eclipse file API to move.    
6.2.2 Create or adjust the file listener to update model data and persist on   
      a change event.    
6.3 Existing infrastructure   
6.3.1 Perform step 6.1.1.3   

7. Acceptance Test
------------------
7.1 Supporting move as an atomic action   

- Perform a move operation   
- A dialog is available for destination selection   
- Only elements that are valid are shown      
- Upon move all referring elements are connected with their referred to elements   
  within scope   
- Upon move all referred to elements are reconnected with their referring    
  elements within scope   
- No IDs have changed
- Undoing the move resets the model in the original state   

7.2 Using eclipse file infrastructure   

- Repeat steps from 7.1   

7.3 Existing infrastructure   

- Cut a model element    
- Paste the model element   
- Upon move all referring elements are connected with their referred to elements   
  within scope   
- Upon move all referred to elements are reconnected with their referring    
  elements within scope   
- No IDs have changed
