= Project Panda - https://support.onefact.net/issues/11939[11939]

**Software Requirements Specification**

== 1 Abstract

Project _Panda_ delivers two components.  The first is a state model
enhancement to the Ciera Java model compiler.  The second is an external
entity that facilitates manipulation of time and date within xtUML models.
This note explains the project from a high-level requirements and project
management point of view.

== 2 Introduction and Background

BridgePoint Verifier and MC-3020 support a modeling feature which allows
actions to be defined on the transitions of state machines supporting
Mealy style as well mixed Mealy/Moore state machines.  This feature
is not present in Ciera (Java model compiler).  This work adds it.

BridgePoint Verifier and model compilers by default manipulate time, date,
durations and delayed events through an external entity named Time with
key letters 'TIM'.  The TIM EE has existed and been stable for many years.
However, it is limited.  The work done in the project addresses the
ability to manipulate and compare date, time and duration values.

== 3 Requirements

All work shall be done within the open source 'xtuml' configuration
management system (currently hosted on github.com) and licensed under the
current licensing of the greater body of BridgePoint and xtUML artifacts
(currently Apache 2.0 and Creative Commons CC0).  No source, models or
documentation shall be proprietary.

=== 3.1 Actions on Transitions

.Actions on Transitions Requirements
[%autowidth,options="header"]
|===
| ID   | Description
| AoT1 | Actions on transitions will be translated in Java source
         code using the Ciera model compiler.
| AoT2 | The semantics of actions on transitions will conform to
         those implemented in BridgePoint Verifier as the defacto
         standard.
| AoT3 | The Ciera user guide shall be updated to reflect this work.
| AoT4 | A test model shall be created and published that tests the
         capability and serves for future regression testing.
|===

=== 3.2 Time Arithmetic

In the following requirements a semantic distinction is made between
_time_ (date/time) and _duration_.  A _time_ is an instant within an
_epoch_ (a point on a timeline) relative to the start of the epoch.
A _duration_ is a quantity of time independent of a starting point.
It is noted that in this design there will be no syntactic distinction;
both _time_ and _duration_ will be core numeric types (integers).

Restated, this work does not introduce a new type.  The type of epoch time
and duration values returned from these bridges will be `integer` with a
tacit unit of seconds.

.Date, Time and Duration Arithmetic Requirements
[%autowidth,options="header"]
|===
| ID  | Description
| TA1 | A new external entity shall be supplied which manipulates time
        relative to an epoch.
| TA2 | A bridge operation shall be supplied through which the start of
        an epoch can be initialized (e.g. `EPOCH::initialize(...)`).
| TA3 | A bridge operation shall be supplied which returns the current
        time as a numeric type expressed as a quantity of seconds since
        the beginning of the epoch (e.g. `EPOCH::current_time() :
        integer`).
| TA4 | A bridge operation shall be supplied which converts numeric time
        values into strings formatted per an input format string
        containing some or all of year, month, day-of-month, hour, minute,
        second (e.g. `EPOCH::format( mytime, "yyyy/MM/dd hh:mm:ss" ) :
        string`).
| TA5 | Comparing two numeric time or duration values shall be provided.
        All operations corresponding to the following operators shall be
        supported:  `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `!=`, `==`.  This will be
        supported directly in OAL.
| TA6 | A subtraction operation shall be supported using the native OAL
        operator `-` with no type checking or error reporting (in the case
        of a negative result).
| TA7 | A means to add a duration to a time value shall be supplied
        directly in OAL using the `+` operator.  No detection (error or
        warning) is supplied to detect addition of multiple time values.
| TA8 | A means to subtract a duration from a time value shall be supplied
        directly in OAL using the `-` operator.  No detection (error or
        warning) is supplied to detect subtraction of a time value from a
        duration.
| TA9 | A time-of-day operation shall be provided which returns a duration
        since the start of the day given a time value (e.g.
        `EPOCH::time_of_day( timeval ) : integer`).
| TA10 | A test model shall be created and published that tests the
         capability and serves for future regression testing.
