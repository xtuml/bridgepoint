== 4 Work Required

The work in bridgepoint concerns updating the Model Verifier implementation of
the Time (TIM) domain. The TIM.java file is the Verifier implementation of the
Time domain.

A decision was made to use the newer Java time and date mechanisms rather than
the pre-Java 8 time and date mechanisms. This was based upon recommendations in
the Java API reference material. It was also decided to use microsecond
resolution, rather than the current millisecond resolution.

=== 4.1 Reference variables

==== 4.1.1 systemEpochOffset

The systemEpochOffset is the difference between a system-defined epoch and a 
user-defined epoch. All usage of Java time functions have to account for this 
value, because they assume an integer value of time is based upon the system-
defined epoch. There is no way to change the epoch in Java without changing 
the calendar (maybe not even then).

==== 4.1.2 timeAdjustmentOffset

The timeAdjustmentOffset is used to track the difference between real time and
adjustments made for simulated time. This offset is used in simulated time to
allow timers to not require adjustment at each time set and advancement, and it
allows for values of time shown to the user to be adjusted correctly.

=== 4.2 Set epoch

__void set_epoch(int day, int month, int year)__ - The date values are 
converted to an integer and then the difference between this value and the 
system epoch is used to set systemEpochOffset.

=== 4.3 Current seconds

__integer current_seconds()__ - Reads the current system time, adjusts for the 
epoch offset and (in simulated time) time adjustments, and returns an integer
value representing the seconds since the epoch.

==== 4.3.1 Timestamp value

__String timestamp_to_string(long timestamp)__ - Returns the value of an 
integer timestamp in a human readable format.

=== 4.4 Formatted time

__String timestamp_format(long timestamp, String format)__ - Parses the 
integer timestamp into the user supplied format string. Format is expected to
be according to the Java 8 API date and time formatting convention.

=== 4.5 Time math

Mathematical and boolean operations between timestamps and integers as supported
by BridgePoint.

=== 4.6 Time of day

__long time_of_day(long timeval)__ - Takes the modulus of the timestamp by the
number of seconds in a day and returns the value.

=== 4.7 Current date and time functions

All of the current date and time functions had to be amended to accommodate the
offset values.

=== 4.8 Simulated time
==== 4.8.1 Set time

__long set_time( int day, int hour, int microsecond, int minute, int month, int
second, int year )__ - This sets the value of the timeAdjustmentOffset anew each
time it is called. The new value is based on the calculated value from the date
parameters, the systemEpochOffest value, and the current_clock return value.

==== 4.8.2 Advance time

__long advance_time(long microseconds)__ - Adds the specified microseconds to
the timeAdjustmentOffset.

== 5 Implementation Comments

=== 5.1 Epoch setting

It should be noted that any timestamps from a prior epoch setting are
invalidated when a new epoch is set. This could be mitigated by a Time model
that related timestamps to a specific epoch setting. This is of little concern
as most applications would only set the epoch once, if at all.

=== 5.2 Time math issues

BridgePoint integers are constrained by implementation decisions to use `int`
instead of the higher resolution `long`. This introduced some problems in
allowing all the desired time math operations. `timestamp` was changed to a
`long` from an `inst<Mapping>`, which allowed this work to proceed, but literal
long values aren't supported by BridgePoint.

=== 5.3 Timer time vs calendar time

Outside the scope of this work, but it should be noted that the <<dr-1>> `Time
versus Duration` discussion outlines why the timer portion of the Time domain
and the calendar time portion should be wholly distinct. There is some crossover
in that the only support for setting an alarm (calendar time event) is via the
normal timer settings.

== 6 Unit Test

See <<dr-3>>

== 7 User Documentation

The OAL document time and date sections should be updated.
