= Support deferred operations in BridgePoint (part 1)

xtUML Project Implementation Note

== 1 Abstract

Deferred operations are supported in MASL and there is desire for them to be
supported by xtUML/OAL.  Additionally, the Ciera model compiler (which is
itself an xtUML/OAL model) uses them. Up to this point, they have been
maintained by hand, but this feature will give them official support within
BridgePoint.

== 2 Introduction and Background

Original analysis note found at <<dr-1>>.

Ciera project found at <<dr-2>>.

== 3 Requirements

These requirements are a modified subset of the requirements proposed in the
original analysis note <<dr-1>>.

3.1 BridgePoint shall supply a CME to mark an instance based operation as a deferred operation.  
3.1.1 The option to mark an operation as a deferred operation shall be available only if the following conditions are met:  
3.1.1.1 The operation is not already a deferred operation.  
3.1.1.2 The operation is an instance based operation.  
3.1.1.3 The class on which the operation is defined is participating as a supertype in at least one subsuper association.  
3.1.2 BridgePoint shall allow the user to choose which supsuper association to defer the operation across.  
3.1.2.1 BridgePoint shall only allow an operation to defer across one supsuper association at a given time.  
3.1.3 BridgePoint shall allow the user to choose whether the deferral is "required" or "optional".  
3.2 BridgePoint shall supply a CME to mark a deferred to operation as local (non-deferred).  
3.2.1 The option to mark an operation as a local operation shall be available only if the operation is already marked as deferred.  
3.3 Details of deferrals applied to operations shall be visible in the Properties view.  
3.4 Ciera shall support deferred operation behavior.  
3.4.1 If a deferred operation is invoked, the subtype of the current instance shall be selected and the operation on the subtype instance shall be invoked.  
3.4.1.1 If there is no subtype instance related, Ciera shall throw an error.
3.4.1.2 If the deferred operation is marked "optional" and there is no deferred to operation in the subtype instance, the deferred operation itself shall be executed.  
3.4.2 Deferred to operations shall be invocable directly.  
3.4.3 Deferred operations which return values, have parameters, or use array types shall be supported.  

== 4 Work Required

4.1 Model deferral

`O_DEF` was added to the Subsystem subsystem as shown in the BridgePoint diagram
in the analysis note <<dr-1>>. Another attribute "required" was added to capture
whether or not the deferred operation requires each subtype to provide an
implementation.

4.2 CMEs

`MakeDeferred` and `MakeLocal` CMEs were introduced along with corresponding
operations on `O_TFR` and action filter (to determine when the CMEs are
visible). PEI data was updated for the new CMEs.

4.3 Persistence

The new `O_DEF` class was added to the persistence tree PEI data as a child of
`O_TFR`.

4.4 Properties

The appropriate PEI data was updated to include deferrals in the properties view

4.5 OOA schema

The schema was updated to include `O_DEF`.

== 5 Implementation Comments

5.1 An MC-Java bug was fixed in the process. The bug was that enumerator values
were generated starting at 1 and not 0. This is not consistent with MC-3020 (and
other model compiler tools), so it makes it impossible to load BridgePoint data
with the MC-3020 SQL loader. The original bug report can be seen at <<dr-4>>.

== 6 Unit Test

6.0 Import the model attached to the issue <<dr-3>> into a new workspace.

6.1 UI testing  
6.1.1 Right click `op1`. Confirm that "Make Deferred..." CME is available.  
6.1.2 Select "Make Deferred...", click Finish. Confirm that `op1` operations
appeared in classes `B` and `C`. With `A::op1` selected, confirm that the
deferral is viewable in properties and that the value for "Required" is
"Required".  
6.1.3 Right click on `op2`. Confirm that "Make Deferred..." CME is _not_ available.  
6.1.4 Right click on `class_based_op`. Confirm that "Make Deferred..." CME is _not_ available.  
6.1.5 Right click on `subtype_op`. Confirm that "Make Deferred..." CME is _not_ available.  
6.1.6 Right click on `op_no_rel`. Confirm that "Make Deferred..." CME is _not_ available.  
6.1.7 Right click on `op3` and select "Make Deferred...". Confirm that the
dropdown box for "Relationship" contains both `R2` and `R3`. Select `R3`,
uncheck "Required", and click Finish. Navigate to the deferral in properties and
confirm that the value for "Required" is "Optional".  
6.1.8 Right click on `E::op3` again and select "Make Local". Confirm that the
deferral disappears from the properties view.  
6.1.9 Right click on `op_no_rel` again and select confirm that the "Make Local"
CME is _not_ available.  

6.2 Ciera behavior test  
6.2.1 Build the project by running `mvn install` in the project directory.
Verify that it builds cleanly with no errors (no "FAIL" tests).  
6.2.2 Run the project by running `bash run.sh` in the project directory. Confirm
that all tests pass.  
6.2.3 Uncomment lines 44 and 45 in `init`. Build and run again. Confirm that an
error is thrown and the program exits. The error should look something like the
following:  
```
No subtype selected
io.ciera.runtime.summit.exceptions.XtumlException: No subtype selected
...
```

== 7 User Documentation

Entries were added in the BridgePoint CME documentation for "Make Deferred..."
and "Make Local".
