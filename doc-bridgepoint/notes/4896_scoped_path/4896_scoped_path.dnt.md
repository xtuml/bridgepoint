# Not possible to specify datatypes with the same name at different levels.
### xtUML Project Design Note


### 1. Abstract

If an enumeration data type with the same name exists at the system level and inside a component, BridgePoint 
currently gives a syntax error that reads there are mulitple enumerations found. This issue is raised to provide a mechanism
that allows types with the same name to exist without this error.

### 6. Design

The work required section of [this issue's analysis note](4896_scoped_enum.ant.md) described a proposed grammar change to satisfy the requirements of this issue. Design started with that grammar. However, discussion and and test during this design phase led to a more flexible grammar. The grammer described in the analysis requires the user to type a full-path specification (including system name). Discussion and test led to the desire to allow a "partial path" solution. This "partial path" solution would allow a user to specify only as much path as is neccessary to disambiguate a conflict. This has the addtional benefit of not requiring a system name to always be present. 

6.1 Here is the grammar before any change was made for this issue:  
```
scoped_access
   :
    scoped_data_type
    TOK_DOUBLECOLON!
    scoped_member
  ;
```

6.2 Here was the grammar proposed as a starting point in analysis:  
```
scoped_access
   :
    (
    scoped_model
    TOK_DOUBLECOLON!
    scoped_package
    )?
    scoped_data_type
    TOK_DOUBLECOLON!
    scoped_member
  ;
  
scoped_model!
  :
    general_name
  ;
  
scoped_package!
  :
    general_name
    (
    TOK_DOUBLECOLON!
    scoped_package
    )*
  ;
  
```


6.3 Following is the grammar that implements partial-path matching. This is the grammer that shall be used.  
The predicate in the scoped_path rule below deserves a bit of explanation here. The difference between a scoped_access that does NOT contain a scoped path and a scoped_access that DOES contain a path is that fact that a scoped_path contains 2 (or more) "general_name doublecolon"s in a row. This lookahead is what allows the grammar to distinguish a scoped_access WITH path from a scoped_ access witout a path.  

```
scoped_access
   :
   (
        scoped_path
        scoped_data_type
        TOK_DOUBLECOLON!
        scoped_member
    )
  ;
scoped_path
  :
    ( 
      ( scoped_path_segment scoped_path_segment )=>
        scoped_path_segment
    )*
  ;
scoped_path_segment
  :
    scoped_path_segment_name
    TOK_DOUBLECOLON!
  ;
```

6.3.1 Partial path grammar implementation  
In this partial-path design, the original scoped_access rule is modified by adding a new rule, scoped_path. This scoped_path rule is defined to have 0 or more elements. Note that when 0 scoped_path elements are present, the behavior is identical to the tool behavior before this concept of path was introduced.  

With the grammar change in place, OAL Validation Utility operations are added for elements generated by the parser. Note that the implemenation of these new OAL Validation Utility functions only need to perform validation of the scoped_path expression, they do not need to create any meta-model instances because the meta-model was NOT changed by this issue.  

Implementation of validation of the partial-path match must consider that full validation of a scoped_access rule which includes one or more scoped_path_segments can not be completed until the entire expression is parsed. This situation where validation has to be "delayed" until the entire expression is in-hand is not new to the BridgePoint OAL parser, however it complicates matters because of the way the OAL Validation Functions are structured. Before this, when such a situation arose, intermediate data was stored in meta-model instances such as Block (`ACT_BLK`). A good example of this is the `InWhereSpec` attribute on Block. The value of this attribute has no meaning to downstream model compilers or Verifier, but it informs the parser that it is currently parsing a "where" expression. Because adding attributes to the meta-model can be messy, it was decided to handle this situation where the entire scoped_access rule needs to be parsed before it is validated by introducing a scoped_path_segment cache. 

6.3.1.1 Caching of path segment information  

To allow the parse of a scoped_access rule to happen before validation two main implementation artifacts shall be added:

6.3.1.1.1 Oal_validate.java::ScopedSegment

Implementation for parser rule validation and instance creation is performed by functions (S_SYNC) that are implemented in OAL. The BridgePoint architecture allows a BridgePoint developer to mark S_SYNCs  that contain these parser implementation functions. The mark, which is handled by MC-Java, is placed in the description field of a package that contains these operations is:  
ParserValidateFunction: TRUE

When a S_SYNC is marked as "ParserValidateFunction: TRUE" (or ParserUtilityFunction: TRUE) the generated code is output to a file: bp.als.oal/src/org/xtuml/bp/als/oal/Oal_validate.java. This Oal_validate.java file is initially created from an archetype, bp.als/arc/validate_gen.arc.  

For this work, validate_gen.arc shall be modified and a new class and array introduced to allow the parsed scoped segments to be changed. Following is the class and array that shall be introduced:


```
    private ArrayList<ScopedSegment> scopedSegments = new ArrayList<ScopedSegment>();
    
    class ScopedSegment {
        Token token;
        String segmentName;
  		
        /**
        * Prevent no-arg constructor
        */
        private ScopedSegment() {
        }
        
        // Only used by the outer class
        ScopedSegment(Token tok, String name) {
            this();
            token = tok;
            segmentName = name;
        }
    }
```

6.3.1.1.2 ooaofooa/Functions/OAL Validation Scoped Access  

Given the new archetectural mechanism put in place to cache path segments, a mechanism to interact with the path segments from OAL is needed. Note that such parser-related utility functions are , by convention, kept in the package OAL Validation Utility Functions in BridgePoint. This is simply convention, and it was observed during design that there would be quite a few new utility operations introduced in support of this scoped-path "cache". A new package was therfore introduced as a sibling to OAL Vaidation Utility Functions. The new package shall be named: OAL Validation Scoped Access.  The following operations shall be introduced in this new package:  

  * ```void scopedsegment_reset()```  
This is used to reset the path cache. This is called as the first statement in Scoped_path_start(), and is placed in this location because this is only called when a scoped_path is being parsed.
  * ```void scopedsegment_add_segment(Token, String)```  
This is used to add a new path segment to the cache. This is called during Scoped_path_segment_name_validate() a segment has been parsed. The Token parameter is the parser Token that represents the segment being parseed. This Token is used for error reporting. The name is the text string of the segment name and it is used during validation.

  * ```inst_ref_set<Packageable Element> scopedmatches_collect(String lookaheadText, boolean validate)```  
This operation collects all possible matches. From OAL implmentation point of view, this routine is by far the most significant function introduced. This function is called in Scoped_data_type_validate() in the case where a scoped_path has been parsed (scopedsegment_size() is greater than 0), as well as by content assist (Scoped_path_lookahead_content_assist()). The "validate" parameter is true for when called for validatation and false when called for context assist. The lookaheadText parameter is empty when called for validation, and is used as the next string to collect a set of instance for in the context assist call. The return value here is a set of elements that are the possible matches for the current path context. There was significant code change fallout in the decision to implement this routine interitively instead of recursively. See Design comment 7.1 for more information about this function and its implementation. 
  * ```int scopedsegment_size()```  
Return the number of scoped_path segments in the cache.
  * ```String scopedsegment_get_segment_name(int index)```  
Returns the path segment string assocaited with the given index.
  * ```Token scopedsegment_get_token (int index)```  
Returns the path segment Token assocaited with the given index.

6.4 Content assist

Content assist had to be updated to include proposals for the new scoping syntax. The content assist list for `rval`s (beginning of any expression) was modified to include all visible system models, packages, and components. The `collectVisibleElementsForName` facility was used to collect only the visible elements. Additionally, Scoped_path_lookahead_content_assist was added and used the `scopedmatches_collect` function as described above to collect all visible next elements given a path specification.

Four new proposal types were added: Component, Package, SystemModel and UDT. These were assigned their appropriate icons and sort order. See design comment 7.2 for discussion about UDT.


### 7. Design Comments

7.1 ```inst_ref_set<Packageable Element> scopedmatches_collect(String lookaheadText, boolean validate)```  

This operation implements the partial-path matching for both validation and content assist. During design, implementations of this functionality were performed in both interitive and recursive forms. The recursive form collected matches in another structure class and array introduced to Oal_validate.java (with a interface similar to the Oal_validate.java::ScopedSegment class described above.  

The interitive form reused a code-pattern used in the previous implementation of Scoped_data_type_validate() (and other places in BridgePoint) that took advantage of the BridgePoint architecture's search facility that uses {C_C | PE_PE | EP_PKG}.collectVisibleElementsForName.  

The interitive solution was simpler and was thus the appraoch taken. With this approach a decision was made to abandon the extra collection that the recursive implementation has used to store matches in favor of allowing the matching routine to return a set of matches. This again greatly simplied the solution but required some "architectural" changes. MC-Java was updated to support returning a value of an instance reference set type. Additionally, the implementation made use of the newly added set union operation. This operation requires the instance reference types of classes involved in the expression to be published (see section 5.3 in [this design note](https://github.com/xtuml/bridgepoint/blob/master/doc-bridgepoint/notes/5007_set_operations/5007_set_operations_dnt.md)).

7.2 UDT content assist proposals

In the original implementation of content assist, UDTs (User Data Types) were not included in proposal lists because it was thought that they cannot be used in OAL. During this work, it was observed that the parser actually allows users to specify literal enumerators of UDTs that are based on an enumeration data type. Because of this, content assist should propose UDTs in all situations where EDTs are proposed given that they are based on an EDT.

   
### 8. User Documentation

The existing documenation shall be modified to update places that describe this behavior as an error and to describe the 
new behavior.  

### 9. Unit Test

9.1 Assure that duplicate-named enumeration data types may exist in separate packages in a model.  
9.2 Assure that duplicate-named constant data types may exist in separate packages in a model.  
9.3 Assure that duplicate-named structured data types may exist in separate packages in a model.  
9.4 Assure that duplicate-named user data types may exist in separate packages in a model.  Note 
that this is already allowed in the tool today. However, it is simply added here for completeness.  
9.5 Test backwards compatibility to assure that existing models do not have parse errors unless duplicates are present.
