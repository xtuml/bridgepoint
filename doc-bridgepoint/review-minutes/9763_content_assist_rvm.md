                                 a pre-review pull request, be sure to look at
                                 them)
x - 11  min   bob       6.3.1.5  A list follows, renumber to make it clear they

                                 not create proposal lists for.  This
                                 optimization is perhaps a seperate topic from
                                 6.4.4, consdier making it 6.4.4.1 to make this

                                 assist is case insensitive. This should be
                                 called out in this document.
