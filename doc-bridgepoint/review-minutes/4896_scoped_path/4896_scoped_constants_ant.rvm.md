-- Num Type  Who  Section  Comment
x- 01  min   SKB  2.3      suggesting --> suggestion
x- 02  min   LPS  3        Constants are not data types.  Fix this throughout.
x- 03  min   CDS  5.1.4    grammer --> grammar (everywhere)

x- 05  min   SKB  5.3      intriduce --> introduce
x- 06  min   xxx  5.3      What about paths?
1) Qualifiers need to follow OAL identifier rules (no blanks).
2) Partial paths that resolve the tie are sufficient.
@Bob, There needs to be a left bracket before scoped_model and another after with a question mark.
x- 07  min   xxx  6.1      model name and/or package names [note plural].
x- 08  min   xxx  9        should be section 7
x- 09  min   xxx  9.5      Remove "fully qualified".

No major observations, a re-review is not required.
