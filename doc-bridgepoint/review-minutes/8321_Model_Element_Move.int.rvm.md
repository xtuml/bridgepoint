x- 03  maj   BM   5.1      The entirety of this big explation needs to be 
  revisited/removed/or fixed.   A few pieces of the details are good, but much
  of the content is no longer a valid description of the work.

x- 17  min   KB   5.4.3    We need to revisit and rethink IPR support. After 
  discussion, the plan is to add a message to the dialog "Check IPR and package visibility
  settings".  We note that visibiltiy checking infrastructure is already in place
  and we will leverage it.

x- 19  min   BM   general   Bob recalled that there was some special case code
  added that MEM will occasionally call via Java reflection.  We don't recall 
  what this was for, but we need to capture the details about it here in this note.
x- 20  min   BM   general   We will move most of the data in this INT to the DNT
