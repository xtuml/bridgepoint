-- Num Type  Who  Section  Comment
x - 01  min   bob  4        There was discussion of adding AE10 and AE11, but they are addtional work
                           that is not required at this time.
x - 02  min   bob  5.2.1      Move this to be a section in the background
x - 03  min   bob  5.2.2      number the options
x - 04  min   bob  5.2.2      Describe that the reason there is no exporter is that there is no 
                             textual representation of structural xtUML to validate against
x - 05  min   bob  5.2.3.2      Add a reference here or in the associated work required.
x - 06  maj   TRL  5       Visibility (public, private, protected). How is this handled?
x - 07  min   bob  5.2.4/6.3      We are not confident in how to do this
x - 08  min   TRL  5      call out verifier. Whatever is stored to the action semantics needs to 
                           still be parseable by verifier in order for verifier to run
x - 09  min   bob  6      Call out the requirement(s) being satisfied to assure they are all covered
x - 10  min   LS  6.2.1      should be: xtuml to masl
x - 11  min   LS  6       need to call out work for AE7 and AE8
x - 12  maj   TRL  5      what about cross-project references? Especially WRT command completion. How do we get the 
                         list of elements?
x - 13  maj   bob  5      Where is the option for not using xtext? Add such an option.
