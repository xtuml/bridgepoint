# xtUML Standard File Headers
### xtUML Project Technical Note

Abstract
--------
Our development process requires that each file produced during a process artifact
shall have a header/footer based on its type.  This document defines the 
header/footer for each file type.


Hand-written Java Files
-----------------------
A handwritten Java only has the header which is :
```

```

Generated Java Files
--------------------
This comment should be embedded in the archetype file that generates the given file.
```

Archetype Files

Archetype files can have the extensions .arc, .inc, .mark, and .clr. All of these files should have the following header:
