Background
----------
With each new year it is necessary to update to copyright messages in the
BridgePoint source repository.  There is a utility for this purpose.  

Intended Audience
-----------------
This document is intended for the BridgePoint development team.

Steps
-----
_- You must have perl installed on your machine
_- Launch Eclipse
_- Update your development workspace with the latest version from HEAD of 
   all BridgePoint projects whose copyrights need to be updated.  This list
   can be obtained from the new-start checklist [2].
   _- In order to speed up the process and only modify the external facing 
      projects, it is recommended you go on disk and move all of the model and 
      documentation projects to another directory before running the update
      script.  After the update is run, you can move the directories back.
_- Checkout the cvs://utilities project in your workspace
_R The utility that is used to update copyright messages is
   cvs://utilities/update-copyright/update-copyright.pl
_R Note: This utility does have a usage screen.  To see it use the --help 
         option.
_- Open a shell
_- cd <development workspace>
_- ./<path>/update-copyright.pl --recursive --year YYYY ./
_R A message will be displayed when the procedure is complete and it will tell 
   you that a file named update-copyright-results.txt has been created.  This
   contains a report of the changes.
_- Examine the report and modify it (and the modified files) to remove:
    _- Items from the ./metadata folder
    _- Items that have 3rd party copyrights. Following are the ones I know of 
       currently.  These will need to be manually "unchanged" after the
       update.
       _- ./com.mentor.nucleus.bp.mc.c.binary/mc3020/ (The files in this folder
       are ignored by RCS and thus will not be checked in and do not need to be
       recorded)
       _- ./model_compilers/mc3020/translate/pt_trans.h
       _- pt_antlr/antrl/Tool.java
       _- ./utilities/ (The files here are not customer facing and do not need
       to be updated)
   _- Anything else you see in the report that you will not be checking-in
_- Search workspace for "opyright*<old year>"
  _- Fix any occurances to new year
_- Commit the modified files to the CVS repository by following normal check-in 
   procedures.
_- Restore the documentation and model directories that were moved out of the
   workspace in an earlier step.
   
_- cd <development workspace>/Documentation/internal/process/templates
  _- <path to copyright utility>/update-copyright.pl --recursive --year YYYY ./
  _- Edit <development workspace>/Documentation/internal/process/standard-file-headers.txt
    _- Search for "opyright*<oldyear>" and update to new year
  _- Combine the update-copyright-results.txt from the templates folder with the
     one generated earlier
  _- Commit the changed files from these steps
_- Commit the update-copyright-results.txt report to the CVS test_results folder.

_- cd <github repository folder>/mc
  _- <path to copyright utility>/update-copyright.pl --recursive --year YYYY ./
  _- Combine the update-copyright-results.txt from the mc folder with the
     one generated earlier
  _- Commit the changed files from these steps
  _- repeat this section again for the other github repositories that 
     contain copyrights that need to be updated.
  
_- Commit the update-copyright-results.txt report to the CVS test_results folder.
