# Interface Verifier with SVX
### xtUML Project Design Note




1. Abstract
-----------
This issue is raised to create an interface between Verifier and SVX so that Verifier 
can integrate with other tools such as System Vision and LabView.

2. History
----------
 

3. Document References

4. Background
-------------
none

5. Requirements
---------------
5.1. Models executing in BridgePoint shall communicate with other tools 
     through a BridgePoint SVX interface.  

5.2. Port marking shall be used to identify the modeled components that 
     shall participate in SVX communication.  

5.3. A model executing in BridgePoint and communicating with other 
     models through SVX shall not need to be aware of the 
     algorithms in the other models. 

5.4 The port marked as svx should have a graphical representation 
    that distiguieshes it from the regular port
  
   
   
6. Analysis
-----------
Refer to the analysis note [1] 


7. Design 
---------
7.1 To be able to use SVX APIs, a file named svx.jar was addded to the bp core 
    plugin dependencies.  The generate.xml was modified to add the svx.jar dependency, 
    and the class path was modified to include svx.jar.  

7.2 Add an attribute to the metamodel class, Port, to allow a port to be
    marked as an svx port.
    While running verifier this attribute is checked, and if true then the 
    communication is routed to get or set values using the SVX APIs.
    This new attribute is of type boolean and named isSVX and its 
    full name is: Mark As SVX.  
 
7.3 Port configurations for the SVX channel configuration of each project. 

    The Port preferences are accessible from the SVX project preferences 
    menu item which is found by right-clicking on a port.  
    
7.3.1 Create an SVX project preference node that shows on the xtuml project when
      selected from model explorer view.   
      
7.3.2 Modify create_core_plugin_class.arc to add the SVX preferences node to the
      core plugin . 
      
7.3.3 Create a SVX preferences page that is used to configure the ports marked as 
      svx. The preferences page shows a drop down list containing only the 
      components that have at least one port marked as svx.
* When a component is selected a table showing all the ports marked as svx 
  on the selected component is shown.
* When a port on that table is selected a check is shown next to the port 
  name, and then all the configurations for that port become editable.
* A secondary table shows all the interface operations along with their  	  
  corresponding configurable SVX signal names.  
	  
7.3.3.1 Port configuration table : 

- There will be no initial values for the fields of this table 
- After the first save the table fields will be populated by the values provided by the user.
These values will be persisted in a file that lives under the folder ".settings" in the project.
- The table columns are:
	- Port Name : not editable
	- Channel Name:  This represents the SVX channel name associated with 
		               the port
	- Port Number :  The port number for SVX communications to go through
	- isAppSequencer : Represents the client that will run first for svx 
		                 (the client with the value false runs first)
	- iP         :   The ip for SVX communications to go through
	- lookUpName :   A name provided for the SVX channel to be looked up in 
		               the system (left empty)
	- seconds    :   The amount of time that is advanced after each execute 
	- value      :   The a magnitude of the time as enumerated steps in 
		               orders of 1000 (supported values are only from 0 to 999)
	- BIGendTime :   The value of time where it would mark the end of the 
		               communication.
- The columns won't be provided a default value.  This is to force the user to enter 
	a value that will make the correct communication with the svx 
	clients running.  If defaults were used, the user might be under the false impression that the 
	default values might make his model run without 
	being modified. 

	- If the values were not provided in this table an error message will show in 
	a verifier session if a user tried to communicate to SVX channel without 
	having these values set first the error message will be: 
	- "No Channel Configuration Was provided for Port : Port_Name  no
        svx connection is established"	
	
7.3.3.2 Signal Name configuration table:
        
- The table shows all the interface operations associate with the selected
  port on the first table 
	- Each Interface Operation is associated with a signal name 
		- The table columns are:
			- Executable Property : Not Editable
			- Signal Name : represents the SVX signal name 011
    
7.3.4 Create SVX preferences store that contains the mapping between ports and 
created channels for them. The store is also responsible for persisting the maps in files under 
".settings" folder of the project. The two files persisted are explained below.

7.3.4.1 The first file maps the port to a created SVX channel corresponding to 
that port the svx channel class[7.3.5]

7.3.4.2 The second file maps the executable property to it's corresponding 
signal name. 

7.3.5 SVXChannel class represents the svx channel created holding its 
      configuration values the values are populated from the table in the 
      preferences window [7.3.3.1]
      
```java      
	class SVXChannel {
	  String portName;
	  String channelName;
	  int portNumber;
	  boolean isAppSequencer;
	  String iP;
	  String lookUpName;
	  double seconds;
	  int value;
	  double BIGendTime;
       }
```

7.4 Add an External Entity to allow communication between the OAL and the java SVX APIs. 
The implementation of the external entity is not generated it is realized code written in java.  
This external entity is named SVX it has two bridge operation:
	
7.4.1 The first bridge opration is named getSVXValue(). This operation has a return type of real.
This one is used to read the value provided for certain signals from the SVX bus.  It has two 
parameters of type UUID these parameters are:
- messageValueId 
- portId 

These parameters are used to resolve the correct svx channel and signal name configured for the value being read
	  
7.4.2 The second bridge operation is named setSVXValue().
- This bridge operation is used to send an svx value to SVX. This one has three parameters of type uuid.
These are:
	- valueId
	- portId
	- invocationId 

These parameters are used to resolve the correct port, the value being sent to the port, and the configured 
signal name.


7.7 Introduce Svx_c.java

    This Java class holda the implementation for the External entity named 
    SVX mentioned above. The main operations of this class are:	
    
7.7.1 Getsvxvalue() 
This operation has a return type Object that gets converted to a float value.  It 
represents the float value that is retrieved from SVX.  This operation has two parameters of the type UUID.
- Messagevalueid 
	- This one represents the ID of the message that is been used to get the svx value.
- Portid 
	- This one represents the id of the port through which  the SVX communication goes.

After resolving the port, the code checks if it initialized, if it wasn't then it initializes it, then 
the code uses SVX API's to read the desired value on that SVX channel. A check is made to make sure 
that the current svx time is less than the big end time configured. If the current time is less than the 
big end time then the value is read using the svx API's,  and time is advanced. 	  

  If the current time exceeded the big end time an error message is shown  to the user as follows:
	
	This  Channel : "channel_name" that is associated with the port : 
	"port_Name" has timed out and value of 0.0 will be returned. Try Increasing 
	the Big End Time
	  
7.7.2 Setsvxvalue() 
This operation is of type void. It has three parameters of type UUID: valueId, portId and invocationId.  
They are used to resolve the float value that is sent to the svx channel, the port through 
which the communication goes, and the interface operation that was invoked to send this 
value to the svx channel.
      
- After resolving the portthe code checks if it initialized, if it wasn't then it initializes it.
Then uses SVX API's to send the resolved value to that SVX channel. A check is made to make sure 
that the current svx time is less than the big end time configured. 
	- If the current time is less than the big end time then the 
value is sent using the svx API's and time is advanced.
	- If the current time exceeded the big end time an error message is shown to
	  the user.  The error is:

	  This  Channel : "channel_name" that is associated with the port : 
	  "port_Name" has timed out Try Increasing the Big End Time

7.7.3 Initialize() 
This operation creates a svx channel associated with each port using the configuration 
values provided by the SVX preferences. It then starts up the svx system.
      
- If the associated channel attribute, isAppSequencer, was marked as true a 
connection connector socket is created and an SVXComponentChannel component channel is created.
- If it is marked as false then connection acceptor sockets are created and not a channel.

It is an SVX convention that the SVX component channel is created at the 
side where isAppSequencer is marked as false. After this is created, this method 
creates the SVX consumers and generators associated with  each SVX channel that corresponds to a component port.

- These consumers/generators are created according to the following:
	- If the port is a requirement and the the interface operation direction 
is from provider then a consumer is created. 
	 - If the port is a provision and the the interface operation direction is
to provider then a consumer is created.

- The consumerMap hashmap gets populated with the value of the UUID of the interface operation 
along with the ISVXNativeHandle representing the consumer created.
	- If the port is a requirement and the the interface operation direction is to 
	provider then a generator is created.
	- If the port is a provision and the the interface operation direction is from 
	provider then a generator is created.
      
- The generatorMap hashmap gets populated with the value of UUID of
the interface operation along with the ISVXNativeHandle representing the generator created
	 	   
- The svx system is started up and hashmaps gets populated as follows  
	- svxNativeJNIMap : maps the SVXNativeJNI to the UUID of the xtuml component
	                    port associated with the svx channel
	- targetMap       : maps the target of the svx channel to the UUID of the 
                        xtuml component port
	- factoryMap      : maps the factory of the svx channel to the UUID of the 
                        xtuml component port
      
- After a successful initialization a message is shown to the user as follows:

	User_c.Loginfo("The channel : " + retSvxChannel.getChannelName()
					+ "that is associated with the port : " + port.getName()
					+ " was initialized successfully"); 

			
7.8 Modify the operation getValue() of the class message Value:

- When this operation can't resolve the needed value, it returns a default value.
An extra case is added to check if the port through which this value is
read is marked as an svx port. The SVX::getSVXValue() bridge operation is 
called and using the uuid paramters sent to it, this operation gets 
the correct sxv handles that resolve the value on the desired 
svx channel and signal name. The value is resolved using the java code 
implementation of that bridge operation.
    
- A return value instance is created that has a data type of type real related to it.  The 
value that is resolved is set to the resolved value.  This is how the resolved values 
from svx are returned to the oal code format.
 	

7.9  Modified the operation excute() in the InterfaceInvocation metamodel class 
- This operation is modified for the case where it is not connected to an other port.  
In this case, when an operation is called across that port, in order to send a value to the svx 
bus the bridge operation SVX::getSVXValue() is used.  

8. Design Comments
------------------
8.1 This current implementation supports only operation calls to get or send float 
values to the SVX channel. It does not interact with timers in verifier.

8.2  Requirement 5.4 is not yet implemented

9. Work Required
----------------
Stated in the Design section 

10. Unit Test
------------
10.1 Run SVX created demo
* Run java project svx_dummy as java application
* Launch test project in xtuml verifier 
* navigate to test>comp>pkg>fn
* execute funtion fn
* (Result) Returns the correct values 

End
