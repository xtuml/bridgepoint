# Port BridgePoint source models to Generic packages
### xtUML Project Design Note

1. Abstract
-----------
We need to migrate the BridgePoint metamodel to generic packages. This note tracks the required work.

2. Document References
----------------------
[1] Clearquest issue dts0101077921 - Port BridgePoint source models to Generic packages

[2] Issues 2, https://github.com/xtuml/internal/issues/263  

3. Background
-------------
We are migrating BridgePoint to an open source environment. The open source editor is restricted in what it can do with Specific Package models, so we need to port the BridgePoint source models to Generic Package s so that the wider community can edit them.

4. Requirements
---------------
1. MC-Java needs to be changed to work with Generic Package models.
2. The BridgePoint build infrastructure must be changed to work with Generic Package models.

5. Analysis
-----------

5.1 Scope

This work makes the build environment produce a good working copy of BridgePoint from models converted to Generic Packages. If possible, no other changes will be made to the BridgePoint meta-model by this work. It follows from this statement of scope that this work does not remove Specific package support from BridgePoint. All it does is to move the BridgePoint source and build infrastructure to Generic Packages. After this work is complete, the BridgePoint developers are no longer dependent on Specific Package functionality, so Specific Package support can be scheduled for removal.

5.2 Work required

A key meta-model element associated with specific packages is Domain (S_DOM). There are 79 references to it in workspace RSL files (i.e. files with arc and inc extensions). Another key meta-model element is Subsystem (S_SS). There are 50 references to this element in workspace RSL files. Many of these references will require no action because they (for example) hook up context menu entries with the Domain or Subsystem. However every one of the references needs to be assessed to see if it needs to change.


6. Design
---------
6.1 Convert all source models to generic packages
This change is responsible for the bulk of the delta for this job. As was hoped, no other changes other than the package style are required to any of the source models. Test models in specific packages remain as specific packages. Since these models are designed to test specific package behavior, these need to stay in place until support for specific packages is removed. The converted models are:

- bp.als/grammar
- bp.core/context_menu
- bp.core/ooaofooa
- bp.core/ooaofooa_hierarchy
- bp.core.test/consistencyTest
- bp.core.test/DeleteTestModel
- bp.core.test/FormalizeUnformalizeTests
- bp.core.test/FormalizeUnformalizeTestsWithPrefix (? already upgraded ?)
- 

7. Design Comments
------------------

8. Unit Test
------------
All JUnit tests must pass.
